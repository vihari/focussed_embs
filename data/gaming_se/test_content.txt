according to gamefly , the left and right triggers will activate the screw .
open the character sheet ( c ) switch to the tab for your companion ( make sure they are active/present ) hit the " customize appearance " button on the middle right check " hide head slot " i am not sure exactly when this was added but it is been at least a few months .
x-com stands for " extraterrestrial combat force " , an organization in the game .
as gnoupi said , it is possible to report any game you want to play as a non-steam game . in this case , it is a joke reference to the episode " make love , not warcraft " of south park , in which butters prefers hello kitty island adventure over world of warcraft . as far as i know no such game exists . by the way , there is a similar exploit where it is possible to show yourself playing a game which you have pre-loaded , but is not yet released , by using a utility that reports the appid to steam . this means you can not even trust the regular in-game titles either . i have been known to " play " left 4 dead 2 and portal 2 prior to its release .

unfortunately , the game does not run cross-platform . on ios , if you have a game center account , your game is tied to it , which is why you can get your tiny tower game on multiple ios devices . obviously , you do not have game center on an android device , so you will not have access to your game .
no , as near as i can tell resource coverage does not affect load/unload speed . resources at a station naturally degenerate over time , so to get a higher% of hauled production , you need to have one vehicle loading at the station all the time . for part 2 of your question in one of my games , i had a station cover two coal mines with just 1 square on each , and i still transported 91% of the production . however , one thing that does affect load/unload speed seems to be the station itself . if your train , for example , is longer than the track it seems like it takes longer to load/unload . also , all the cars on the train load simultaneously , so 10xoil tanker train will load more oil per ' tick ' than a 5xoil train , but it takes approximately the same amount of time for both trains to reach 100% capacity ( assuming enough oil at the station and it is long enough to accommodate both trains ) .
with the 1.9 skyrim patch there is no limit to the levels you can achieve , so you could get all the perks in theory . alternatively , on pc , there are mods that can give you extra perk points . for example i use spend dragon souls for perks . otherwise search the workshop for ' perk ' and see what you find : e.g. perk potions
seems like , you did not have a flush . according to the omaha hi/lo poker rules from pokerstars : all players use exactly two cards from their four hole cards in conjunction with exactly three cards from the board to make the best five-card poker hand possible . since you only had 1 diamonds card ( king ) in your hole cards ( your hand ) , you could not make a flush .
gregtech did in fact do it . it is hard to find documentation where this is stated officially but i have been roaming the ftb forums and have confirmed that gregtech changed a lot of stuff after 1.4.7 .
i have seen these guys all over , generally in zones still controlled by the templars . it never occurred to me that they were trying to dismantle the ziplines - they just seemed to be working on them in some way . it made sense in my head since these templars always seemed to be working on the tops of ziplines while regular guards always seemed to be stationed at the bottoms of ziplines ( so that i could assassinate them more conveniently ) . to answer your question , i imagine that when templars control a zone , they know assassins might try to gain access via zipline , so they try to destroy it . but as far as i know they never get far enough to actually disable a zipline . i think it is just a visual cue to let you know that you are in a templar-ridden area and that they want to disable your ability to move around .
the enemies ( the game calls them " pests" ) get easier to deal with after you get one of the four upgrades . so , you can skip some rooms and come back to them later . or , the best strategy i have found so far is to just come into the room and quickly ( generally by teleporting ) try to turn on all the lights .

it is known , and somewhat-new . as of march 20 , 2014 , a new ability was added to the heat sink , thanks to iqtech research . an article was written to break down the changes into greater detail , next generation of heat sinks . in short , addition of a heat sink to a portal will reset both the cooldown timer , as well as reset the burnout counter . both of these resets only apply to the agent deploying the heat sink . source : http://decodeingress.me/ingress-manual/ingress-items/portal-mods/heat-sink/ the idea is that by deploying a heat sink , you get the bonus hacks , but not the enemy agent who wants to leech your farm before taking it down .
you are unable to withdraw the funds directly after depositing into the battle .netaccount balance . however you could possibly find a good diablo 3 item to purchase worth around the amount you want to withdraw on the real-money auction house and re-sell it listing with paypal as the posting method . not an ideal way to go about it , but the only way to really move funds around is by selling items .
it is called ascension by composer neal acree , featuring the skywalker symphony and chorus , and vocalist laurie ann haus . neal acree has released the full track on his youtube page : i stumbled upon this a few days ago . i hope you are still around to enjoy it !

microsoft has changed the looks of its controllers over time . for instance , my original wireless controller from my elite looks identical to the images you showed , and says microsoft twice on the top of the controller ( one hologram , one etched in ) . my newer wireless controller , that came with the wireless adapter for windows , is all black , and only has the hologram on the top with xbox 360 etched in the top . on both controllers , the hologram is right above the battery pack , so it may be located in a different location on a wired controller .
i like to play support too . first thing about warding is : any player should be responsible for its own warding meaning that the support player should not be asked to ward top+mid+bot all the time and especially in early game . in the game ( early at least ) , the support champion has to protect the carry at all cost . he wards for him , he buffs for him , he dies for him ( nb : never die for a carry that will die no matter what you could do ) . edit march'12 : after watching some pro games on the intel extreme masters stream , i can confirm that any team has multiple player warding there lanes . even at the beginning to catch junglers . edit march'13 : unless you are playing as a team , and even with a team , this will not happen . you will be sole responsible for the vision on the map ( and failing to do so , putting more than your max ward capacity etc . but that is another problem ) . what to ward early game places you want to ward are : bushes that pretty all for the start . however , you will not have many wards , so you must chose the right spot : normal setting , no advantage on the map , the battles are mainly located at mid-map . the enemy has very high usage of their bushes and intel is more important than gank protection ( if affordable go for 1+2 in these cases ) . note that the enemy sould have a high usage of bushes for themselves ( not traps ) . low usage of bushes and traps can be dealt with your cv ! when your tower is under siege , it is better to go for ward 3 , as you would see gankers from 1 early enough . remember , jungler often stops at bushes but not always . once they are leaving the covers , it is too late . if their ganker is fast , forget the bushes and go up the river to ward . the better you know the enemy , the better you can ward appropriately . edit march'12 : with good judgement , you will managed to place the ward at the very edge of the bush , to maximise the vision range ( see next picture ) . after more practise , i found out that good use of a vision ward can get a tremendous advantage for your team . to be able to use this tip correctly , you will need to know better than where to ward . you need to know where do your enemy support wards ! if you do not have better use for it , it is time to put your cv in action . when the support leaves the lane for a short time , pop a cv to see what he is doing . eventually you will see him ward somewhere . from there , you can assume he will try to do so repeatedly . once done , get a pink and get his ward off . the best is to be able to combine warding and unwarding and with practise you will be able to put them in a good warding spot which still reveals the enemy ward . remember , a good pink ward is 125 - 75 - 25 = only 25 more gold than a green one . the following images show a usual spot where support tends to put wards these days . i am not fond of this spot because of two things : it does not cover the bushes it does not cover the river high enough and i will prefer the yellow spot instead . the only interest i can credit that violet spot is for violet team which can cover river plus the forest in case of jungler . but if you are pushing so much , you may afford to ward the tribush and the river instead . edit march'13 : deception is also a good tactic to ensure you will dominate the warding ward . if the enemy support as a pink ward , you can try to lure him into using it . the two main tactics are : putting an explorer ward ( that ward from the season 3 mastery ) . it is only 1 minute and gives only 10g upon destruction , but can do the trick . fake warding : go into a not warded bush ( usually river bush is the best for this trick ) and the enemy will assume you have done so to ward . eventually they will try to unward with their pink ward . if you can put up one of this trick : mission 's done . place your own ping ward , gain 25g and a mid-term advantage on vision ( you can only have one pink at start of the game ) . how not to be deceived by this technique : look the support 's inventory ! count his wards ( 1 pink , 2 green , 1 explorer ) . whenever you do not know what he did : just check . if you did forget to check some tips : know the common starting build price : 180g for a faerie charm , 125g for pink , 75g for green and 35 per potion . with masteries , you can usually go for faerie charm , 1 pink , 2 green and 2 potions . if support has the cookie , he also has the explorer ward ( cookie is worthless apart for unlocking the explorer ward ) another method to gain the ward war : be sure to have more pinks than your enemies . it is basic mathematics . if you have one pink more than them , they can not deny you vision . you land your pink , they unward , you unward ( repeat as many as necessary ) . how could you lose this ? you need your carry to be aware that two pinks will be up . if you can defend your pink , you will win . fail to do this and you will lose , even with one more pink . invisible enemies when facing invisible enemies , you may want to go pink as soon as they start being annoying by being hidden too much . the following two spots should cover the missing gap after your turret to the mid-map . remember , the support has to protect his carry ! so if you are ganked by invisible laning enemy and can not ward the river , just forget it . protect the local area from the laning enemies , do not push too much and use your cv . and if your carry is good enough , he might actually be able to get some kill that will surprise the stealth champion . after the laning phase , having a pink ward is also an easy and cheap counter to strong invisible champions like akali . she pops her shroud and think she is invisible ? pop your pink in the middle ( near is enough , but you probably will have your cursor in the middle of her shroud ) , et voilà ! almost guaranteed instant kill . this tip does not work so great with shaco . mid and late game the bigger map show multiples points . red one are for attack , blue for defence and yellow for special . let 's talk about yellow first . you want to know when the other team goes for dragon and baron . you will place the ward near the entrance of the wells since it let you see the all thing in case someone jumps the trees . soft yellow spot are to be placed whenever you attempt to kill the corresponding dragon so as to be able to back-off if enemy come ( or get them before they can gather ) on attack , you have the advantage and you need directions intelligence . if you can predict where the defenders are going , you are able to track them . critical positions are red and blue bush . defenders will try to get any advantage to counter the rushes you put on them . denying red and blue is good for you . small bushes near the wraiths is also a good indicator to protect you from being flanked . sometimes a ward in the enemy base is very practical to ensure they are still defending against super minions while your are killing the baron . on defence , you need to see the attackers as much as possible . so ward positions differ from the attacker 's one . for our objective we do not want to control directions anymore , but positions . note that the soft blue spot indicates places you can ward from defensive positions ( over trees , or wall ) if you can not afford putting a better ward . edit march'12 : when the position is still undecided , teams usually try to harass mid-map . two good positions to control are the following : when should you go to ward : early game : any time you can afford to lose tempo every time i pushed my lane and know i will not be able to do heavy damage to the turret and the supported champion in not in immediate need of support , i go refresh some wards . when ward has/will expired it is critical to have a good sense of timing . if you can anticipate ward expiration , you would be able to refresh it at the best possible time . when switching lane when you switch lane for some reason , be nice : drop ward for your new lane friend ( s ) . when you are losing ! if you are losing your lane , it means you are weaker . and weaker lanes are prime target for ganks , as they provide easy kills . middle game by that time , you should be gathering with your team . use any occasion when your are moving with your team to leave ward behind you . do small detour when necessary , but not too much . when not to ward : i never go warding alone on late game unless i am sure i am not going to be cornered in the forest . the ward is not worth your death ! avoid warding when you can be seen ( it is always better to stay under the radar ) : delay , use confusion or change position if you can afford it . when should i buy wards if you are playing support , ward is your first and your last item , it appears in the tab menu and in the statistics . my build uses gold items , so i buy the first element for it and 3 wards at start . then i always try to buy ward when at the base ( at least 3 if i really need other item badly ) . do not delay buying wards or you will not . when you run out of ward , notify it . refill when you can : 5 wards are 375gp . edit march'13 : if you claim to be a good support , never go out of the fountain without ward . if you can not buy an item because you bought wards instead , it is perfectly normal ! season 3 update : the sightstone and ruby sightstone sightstone and ruby sightstone are two new items introduced buy the season 3 . the latter is an upgrade of the former . sightstone works by providing a self-replenishing stock of green ward . you can keep a maximum of 4 wards ( 5 with ruby stone ) and put up a maximum of 2 live ward at a time ( 3 with ruby stone ) . any subsequent ward placed after this maximum will automatically remove the oldest ward . the item cost 950g . it is paying for itself after 3 recalls ( the pool is worth 300g of wards ) . this is huge ! furthermore , it provide more health points , making it a must have for any squishy support ( like sona , nami etc ) . besides , it allow for more situational warding . should you put a temporary ward somewhere , it will remove an old one , which should be less important at this time than the new one you set up . what does it cost you ? nothing but time . so two words about the sighstone as support : buy it ! vision ward and clairvoyance the last words i can drop here too are for vision wards and cv . vision ward are expensive , but they could be useful sometimes to uncover invisible heroes . my view on this is : every invisible heroes tends to hide in bushes before going stealth , at least in early games ( to maximise stealth time ) , thus falling in our sight ward intel . furthermore , stealth is detected by towers . i honestly rarely use those wards . and they are outmatched by a good oracle late game . but should i use them , the placement differs from normal sight wards . objective here is to cover the largest valuable area . this can be problematic on top and bot lanes , as we would be interested in covering bushes but that renders half the ward area useless . clairvoyance summoner spell is very useful . use it every time you can . with a 55 cooldown reduce at 50 by mystical vision mastery , you can literally spam it . on early game , a well placed cv ( see picture ) should be able to reveal all bushes . if you do not need cv on your lane , use it on other lanes . try to know if teamates could use it , especially junglers . if nobody needs it , check reds/blues for enemy jungler and dragons to be sure the enemy is not looking at them . in solo queue games , at start , you may want to know how the enemy leaves the fountain to have insight on who you will see top/mid/bot and their starting item . this is rarely useful with teamates because : laning postions are often easy to guess you know which teamate goes to one lane you will need it to try a counter jungling if you are only protecting your jungle , use it to cover your jungler from being gank before start . warding without cv edit may'12 if you do not have cv , you can not get insight of what the enemy support is doing , including where she is warding . unwarding is then a mix of timing , knowledge and luck . usually , you can get a good information by counting how long the enemy support is mia . short time means river bush , or that other point i do not really like . long time means dragon . your best shot when unsure remains a vision ward in the river bush . with this you can get : wards in bush ward around the bush ward of the dragon if the support has been too hasty and put it too low . warding dangers edit may'12 warding is always a risky operation . you never know when another player/jungler will show up . maybe someone is hiding in the bush . avoid at all cost dying while warding . you can stay alive with : cv to light the area you are going to having a cc spell ready for escape having your flash up being with another champion use spells that reveals close enemies or give a hint of their presence ( soraka q available , lulu 's glitterlance has a specific sound when it hits , . . . ) there may be some case for which warding is more valuable than your life . in that case , be sure to put your ward ! doing baron edit may'12 when you are going for baron , you need wards because : enemy will try to stop you enemy will try to steal nashor to avoid this , you need to be aware of enemies movements and impair their vision . you do so by : warding your team color spots putting a vision ward at yellow point putting a ward at white spot : this allow you to control enemy over the border . if you see the enemy moving in order to flash in , use your cc ability to prevent this ( lulu 's whimsy for example ) i think i am done now . good luck .
as a computer guy and a gamer , i have always preferred a solid wired connection . however , with wireless technologies such as 802.11n that is not really that big a deal any more , even 802.11g is still suitable for good gaming . your ping times will definitely suffer a little bit when playing wireless instead of a cabled connection , but it will not be a bad choice . if you value a slightly ( very small increase here ) better reaction time , then a wired connection is the way to go ( as in the case of first person shooters , fighting games , etc ) but if you are using it for things like netflix or streaming media/downloading dlc , indie games , etc . wireless will work just fine . edit : i just looked up the specs for the 360s , if you get a wireless router capable of broadcasting at 802.11n you will not have any problems ( assuming you do not have any other major types of wireless interference [ a cordless phone does not count ] ) . just make sure that you set up your wireless network to broadcast on a channel that is not in use nearby . the standard channels are 1 , 6 , or 11 because they allow for the least amount of overlap if they run into another signal .
these sort of messages are typically received from civilizations that are hostile to your own . i believe the idea behind those is to let you know that civilization is hostile to you . to give you a hint about the areas in which you are lacking ( e . g . if they say you are uncivilized , it indicates your culture output is too low ) . i am pretty sure that among the two response options , one is just to slightly increase the hostility and one to slightly decrease it , basically giving you some influence about the future of the relations .
i am playing on an iphone 5s so my answer may not apply to your situation . what i can only suggest is that you update your version of tds to the latest version , and after that to force quit the app , and restart the app . also , if you did complete the last event and had gotten your limited edition characters like r2-q5 , you may have mistakenly think that the random appearance of r2-q5 is an imperial decorator droid when it is just another normal random appearance . hence , when you send this r2-q5 to a floor , it would not decorate the floor . it would just scuttle off , like all other random characters with a " ? " . to distinguish whether it is a decorator droid , you would see the imperial icon on the bottom left of the screen when it appears . so do be on the look-out to see if the black r2 unit you get on your elevator is a " ? " character or one with an imperial icon . and if it is one that appears together with an imperial icon , but do not decorate your floors ( it does not decorate those floors still under construction ) , then you should seek the help of technical support . not related to your question but a helpful observation : decorator droids for this event seems much harder to come by . i only have 3 or maximum 4 random decorator droids ( and that is including the 1st one which can be summoned for free ) in my game so far . i finished the last 2 events quite easily , but i have had to use bux to summon 28-29 decorator droids this time round ( which may be the devs ' design to get us to spend bux , what with the recent salvage droids update etc ) . decorator droid r2-q5
the trick with nascar driving is to turn off the abs . that was the only way i could complete the jeff gordon special events .
sadly no , but you will surely not miss any important objects becasue they sparkle and are nearly impossible to miss . i think i have missed countless journal bags that have the lore information , but there is no way to highlight these things other than putting your cursor over them .
from personal experience , on harder levels : monsters have more health monsters do more damage i think they walk faster however , also on harder difficulties : you gain more xp monsters drop stronger and more valuable loot monsters drop more mana

first and foremost - get a pre-emptitive strike by approaching from behind . pasarans can move through walls but they are still relatively slow in their floating . getting the first turn is crucial for all kinds of setup . the first stratum pasarans have run away , which is a leg skill . if you bind their legs , they cannot run away , and you will be free to beat on them . to your convenience , one of the better leg-binding moves is an early skill for the ninja , who naturally tends to be fast and can usually pull it off before it runs away ( should you have failed to land the bind in your free turn ) . the pasaran has 120 hp that you will need to break through . this is just stalling for time , though - you will need to make sure you can do all that damage . you can improve stalling by adding additional effects like paralyze for its chance , sleep for its full disable and extra damage , and stun if you can land it . the lion , if used properly , is exceptionally potent for a combination of stun , paralyze , and high damage . also keep in mind limit skills that activate at the start of the turn - you can use these to clutch victory right when your stalling is out . each of the first five strata will have its own kinds of adorable pasarans that may appear . they each have their own entry in the monstrous codex . killing a pasaran is worth a ton of experience . they are very , very nice . the lower the stratum , the better the rewards . however , their tricks to hose you and your rewards differ with each one . i have included these in spoilers so that you can access them at your discretion - they also include hp values so you can figure whether your attack power will be great enough . second stratum : looks to its left and has 220 hp . and it explodes ! this harms all of your party and also destroys it for no reward . you need to bind its head to prevent this . third stratum : looks to its right and has 350 hp . explodes or runs away ! you need to either be really really quick , or need to pull off both binds . fourth stratum : has its arms raised , hee , and has 480 hp . in addition to possibly exploding or running away , it also has an ability where it will put its arms down - this transforms it back into the first stratum pasaran , complete with pathetic rewards ! arm bind will prevent that . they tend to prioritize doing this over exploding or running away , because they are mean like that . fifth stratum : here 's the crazy one . there are actually three kinds , but you only encounter the first directly . all three versions have 650 hp . blue pasarans are happy and explode , but more relevantly , if they are hit with a fire , cold , or volt attack , they will multiply into a new one ! the color is based on the element , you obviously get more blue if you use cold attacks . multiply is essential for maximizing your gains , and for this reason getting first strike is even more important . be careful , though , as mistiming or falling short can end up with 5 pasarans exploding in one turn , which can deny your party 's life instead of just rewards of battle . red pasarans are worth the most experience of all pasarans , and are made from fire attacks . these angry guys possess the ability to both explode for major damage , hit all allies for fire damage ( but they stick around ) , or they can lower their arms like the fourth stratum pasarans . kill them quick . gold pasarans are the only ones with a drop - they can drop an item that sells for a lot of gold . they multiply from volt attacks . however , these sleepyheads have an attack , unload , that hits all of you for lightning damage and destroys their drop . so you have to kill them before they pull this off . i have , alas , forgotten which bind stops unload but at this point it is a better idea to just kill them immediately , ideally by limit skill .
in the early game , shooting down ufos is going to be your only real source for these materials , so you are extremely limited to the amount of elerium and alloy you are able to acquire . as you progress into the later game , the more advanced aliens , namely heavy floaters , cyber disks , and sectopods , start to " drop " these items ( or are built out of them ) . in short , the only way to acquire these materials is to go on missions . shooting down a ufo ( or better yet , invading a landed ufo ) is the surest way to get these rarities .
usually you have got four basic concepts to fight drones and other smaller craft : drones : especially for new players , drones are usually the easiest way to fight smaller craft your ship 's guns cant hit . however , based on your skills and your enemies , your drones might be too weak to break a small attacker 's tank ( especially true for elite frigates ) . avoid close quarters : fight smaller ships before they are able to orbit you . this way even battleships can take out frigates or drones in a single hit . based on the speed of the enemy , this might be impossible ( some spider drones fly 5 km/s or faster ) . reduce the enemy 's transversal : or in other words : slow down his orbiting speed so he is easier to hit . there are basically two possible approaches for this . either try to web down the enemy ( the module is for medium powered slots and called a stasis webifier ; it will reduce his speed by 50% or more ) or try to outrun the enemy ( i.e. . flying away so he has to follow you , negating his transversal or approaching speed ) . the latter can be tricky , especially if you are in a slower ships . fast ships , like most minmatar ships as well as faction ships associated with the angel cartel really shine when trying this . try a different weapon system : do not use artillery weapons , when you know you are going to face lots of close range enemies . based on ship bonuses , skills , etc . this is not necessarily a real solution though . if you are still new into " kiting " ( i.e. . outrunning your enemies ) , you might be better off using close range weapons though ( e . g . autocannons or blasters ) . missiles could be a different option , because they do not require tracking . they will , however , still do less damage against smaller/faster targets .
there was some wonderfully scientific work done by scottes over on the gearbox software forums . he summarizes , " i can not tell the difference between fri and non-fri runs . " in other words , find rare items does nothing . here are his two posts on the topic : 1 and 2 .
it looks like it means that your xmp make double damages . critical just means double damage . so for example a l1 burster at zero distance will do 300 damage rather than 150 . that is what i have been observing . this doubling is affected by distance . as the damage is relative to resonator energy/level and it is rounded up to a minimum of 1% ( even if it is 0.2% for example when hiting a high level resonator with a level 1 burster ) you get those critical 1% hits . source
you can set quick buttons for the key items you frequently use . for instance , this thread is related . here is how you do it : go to your bag and select the key item : you will then find the REGISTER option . click on that . then depending on what items you register first , you will see them appear whenever you press y : here , i simply need to press right ( on any directional pad ) to access my super rod .

i think the best example of someone that falls off late game is ap sion . early game he is an absolute terror and can destroy just about anyone ; late game he struggles with relevance . @mario 's answer suggests that this is due to poor scaling , so lets take a look at sion 's abilities and base stats . Cryptic gaze: 70 / 125 / 180 / 240 / 300 (+ 90% AP) Death's Caress(dmg and shield strength): 100 / 150 / 200 / 250 / 300 (+ 90% AP) a . 9 ratio is nothing to scoff at . for comparison , karthus ' lay waste ( single target ) and requiem have a . 6 ratio and his defile is only at . 25 . let 's compare sion 's base stats to mordekaiser 's . sion health 403 ( +104 ) armor 17.75 ( +3.25 ) magic res . 30 ( +1.25 ) mordekaiser health 421 ( +80 ) armor 15 ( +3.5 ) magic res 30 ( +1.25 ) as you can see their level 1 base stats are extremely similar , assuming they are fighting an ap base stats would tend to suggest that mordekaiser would be stronger early . at 18 , sion has 390 additional base health over mordekaiser - suggesting that sion would be stronger than morde late game . this , however , is clearly not the case . so then what exactly makes sion fall off late game ? his kit . sion is extremely good early because he can effectively stun and shield burst to kill most champions . once late game hits champions will generally ( either naturally or build to be ) tankier and be able to withstand this combo and peeling becomes much more effective . ( ie , the adc can lifesteal a respectable amount during cc ) ultimately , the key to any champion falling off towards late game is their inability to no longer burst a target down and their impact in team fights is greatly reduced because of it . this seems to be the case to me with any early game champ ( shaco , lee sin , renekton , etc ) . ( stats taken from league of legends wiki )
bulbapedia 's pretty good on this , but i will try to answer some of your questions here . when you switch blocks they will stay like that until you switch them again . they ' level ' by keeping that block out for 10 days , and some pokemon only appear when you put certain objects/blocks of certain levels into the safari zone .
every classes first companion has three major quests that will take you off the ship ; one per act . this is in addition to the ' quests ' that are your on-ship conversations with all of your crew members . these , like the three ' major ' quests , are unlocked by a combination of affection and class story progression . if you get your companion affection substantially ahead of the plot curve ( say , via gifts ) , you can use these conversations to see a nice xp boost at the start of each chapter .
no , i have tried this twice . you just get the standard rewards from clearing the bounties in the act . if you talk to tyrael after completing the last act , he can even incorrectly suggest that some other town needs your help . do note that two acts grant double the usual number of blood shards when you complete the bounties for those acts ( marked with " bonus " on the world map ) . so it is worth at least doing two acts worth of bounties before making a new game .
what about running a local multiplayer game with a low player count ? ( to prevent others from joining ) that should make the gamemode behave as usual , without the extra people . ( you can probably create a server through the multiplayer menu . )
when a follower mysteriously disappears , there are one of three things that have happened : they are dead . sorry . if you want your stuff , you will want to find where they died . if she was with you up to just recently , backtracking should not be too difficult . they bugged out . this one 's pretty easy to resolve : enter a new area or fast travel somewhere . they will be right behind you . they went home . this is what the message refers to . return to where you picked them up originally : in the case of lydia , that means breezehome ( if you have purchased it ) or dragonsreach in whiterun .
without skills you can only place one tower with one level 1 gem . with this its hard to kill even the first wave . use the field c8 , create a tower near mana shards . the tower should kill few monsters from first wave and before the rest comes ( build walls so the monsters have the longest path to your tower ) you should have harvested enough mana to upgrade the first gem . when you can afford it build the second tower that can help kill monsters and harvest other mana shards . when you clear one from four mana shards in a group build a tower on the cleared spot . that gives you four towers which will harvest all of mana and should kill all the monsters . watch out for the giants - focus on one gem for maximum damage , the rest is only for swarm waves . yol strategy requires to much mana - i used pure lime . you could mix in just a little blue for extra damage but use of slow is negligible .
it used to be 4 medals , due to the fact there are more medals now since 1.2 it has been changed to 8 medals without dying .
there is an npc named gavlan that will purchase items and equipment from the player . he is the only npc that serves this function . he is initially found in no-man 's wharf but moves once you have spoken to him . this means that at each location until the final one , you will only be able to sell to him once . the second location is : harvest valley the third and final location is : doors of pharros source is the collector 's edition guidebook , pg 428 .
let 's look at each item , and how it affects gangplank : philosopher 's stone - this is a strong item on many champions . it gives him the mana regen he needs to use parrrley , hp regen , and gp/5 . wriggle 's lantern - provides armor , ad , life steal , a unique passive and a free ward . this is another strong pick , especially if jungling gangplank . mercury treads - these boots are considered the default tank boots , due to mr and tenacity . spirit visage - provides health , magic resist , cdr , and a boost to healing . i do not recommend this item because it does not synergize well with any of his abilities . frozen heart - provides armor , mana , cdr , and an aura debuff . this item is best vs an auto-attack heavy team , otherwise i would skip it . thornmail - provides armor , and deals magic damage when auto-attacked . i do not recommend this item on gangplank , because a clever opponent will stop focusing gangplank when they see you have purchased it . since your goal is to be a tank , this is counter-productive . warmogs armor - provides the most health in any item , and good health regen . helpful for staying alive . atma 's impaler - provides 15 ad for every 1k hp , armor , and crit chance . a solid pick if you have extra health from runes/items . the first build you have listed is very defensive . you end with 229 armor and 55 mr . this build would be most effective against a team that relies on auto-attacks ( master yi , ashe , etc ) . it is going to be weaker vs a team doing primarily magic damage . warmog 's and atma 's provides more health ( good if you have armor/mr ) , and some damage , which helps if you are jungling gangplank , it is common to rush a wriggle 's first . if you are top lane , you are going to focus on spamming parrrley instead , so i would recommend rushing a philosopher 's stone . sheen is a common pick , because parrrley trigger 's sheen 's bonus damage . it also builds into a triforce , an item that boosts all of gangplank 's abilities . every game is different , and you have to build vs your enemy team . of all the items listed , mercury treads and a philosopher 's stone are always viable . wriggle 's is very common to see on him , and most of the time will be a good pick . from there , build a sheen if you are using parrrley a lot , or health , armor , and/or magic resist depending on what is doing the most damage to you . tl ; dr : mercury treads , philosopher 's stone , and wriggle 's lantern are almost always good picks . everything else is situational .
when you activate the teleportato in sandbox mode , you will receive xp for the days that you have survived and be able to change characters . going through the teleportato will keep your current inventory and all of your prototypes . this new world is only going to be different geographically . the monsters have the same hp and attack power ; they will behave in the same way as you would find them in your first world . you are just generating a new world to exploit explore ! sources : klei forums , steam user forums , personal gameplay .
there is been a massive amount of changes . obviously there are new zones , new battlegrounds , higher level cap , new skills , etc , but i will try to cover the biggest changes as they will probably affect your character : two new classes , death knights and monks . new professions , including inscription which affects every character through the addition of glyphs to modify your own talents and spells . completely redone talents : there are now only 3 talents to pick from for each tier ( and there is a tier every 15 levels ) . this was instituted because a staggeringly high number of talent trees had almost identical builds . these new talents represent the minor variations from the stock builds . specialization ( bm vs mm vs survival ) is now separated out from your talents . there are no longer " bm " talents or " mm " talents . removal of many statistics from items , e.g. attack power , spell power , and the addition of " mastery " . the dungeon finder makes running dungeons infinitely easier for dps , as it is really quite easy to get pick-up groups compared to vanilla and tbc . new raid difficulties : lfr - dungeon finder , but for raids ! flex - anywhere from 10 to 25 man raids . bosses scale to howevery many you have . no more waiting for 2 more dps - it just scales back the boss to make it a fair fight . normal 10 and 25 heroic 10 and 25 ( tougher bosses , better loot ) badges of justice/valor replaced with justice points and valor points . valor points mainly used for upgrading gear . for example , a 528 lfr piece can be upgraded to a 532 for 250 valor points , and again to 536 for 250 more . the ability to raid in pick-up groups quite successfully in each tier . achievements . hunter specific : no ammo ( speaking as a fellow hunter ) ! no more " bow slot " ( librums , totems , idols , wands ) . bows and wands are now actual main hand weapons . so no more agil-staffs or polearms for hunters ! pet talent trees hunters use focus now , very similar to rogues energy .
it simply shows you that city on the map as an unexplored location . it is a good way for new players to populate their maps with major cities and towns .
i currently have a fish that is rising rapidly and at 21km . i am just going to let it keep going and see how high it will go . i am assuming this is some kind of bug because it does not seem to be slowing down at all , after the moon are stars , after that the stars get less and less dense and at this point there are no stars i am just in black space . . . . i let it run over night and it was up to 800km before i shot the fish .
many merchants will sell dyes . i know that as soon as you reach act 2 , there is a merchant who has a variety of dyes for sale , but i found some merchants in act 1 who also sold them . of course , if you have the collector 's edition , you should also have access to the special dyes that were part of that package .
desura does not think you have installed it , it is offering you options how to proceed if it is installed or not - if you have the client installed you click the first button , if you do not you click the other button . there is no desura client for os x , but they do offer standalone os x distributions through the site .
to answer #1 i constructed a test rig . as you described , the outer-engines overheat faster than the inner one regardless of vertical placement . this means that the overheating is not a result of the heat emission map ( which extends in a cone underneath the engine that drops off rapidly and is hotter than the engine itself ) . when i placed temperature gauges on the same rig it did not overheat at all which inadvertently gives us our answer . all parts have three config parameters relating to heat : maxTemp , heatConductivity and heatDissapation . by default conductivity and dissapation are set to 0.08 and they are never redefined in the config files . this means that all parts , even the tiny temperature gauge will receive heat from neighboring components at the same rate . in our scenario the inner engine has four components with which to transfer heat via conduction but the outer ones only have one so they overheat faster . to prevent the outer-engines from overheating you could install a heat sink in the form of a few structural girders . as for #2 the wiki states that : as of 0.18.2 , this tank does not transfer heat effectively . engines attached directly to it and running at full throttle ( especially mainsails ) will overheat . i suspect this is a deliberate tweak in the coding since my usual trick of adding a small girder between the tank and engine reduces overheating by an approximate factor of 8 instead of a factor of 2 which you would expect from abusing the heat conductivity parameter as described above . edit based on a comment by philipp i re-checked the results of #1 and it turns out that the inner engine heats up at a slower rate by transferring heat upwards into the command pod , not across to the other engines as i assumed .
she will not use elven stuff because it is weaker than her heavy type steel armor , i guess because she is skilled in heavy armor and not in light armor . i have given her dwarven stuff and she equipped it on the spot myself . as for why she did equip the elven helm , well she does not have a helm at all in her default gear so any helm is better than what she has no matter the stats .

you can read it there , some dialogs are different based on your previous choices but no major changes . link to an official interview concerning this their are no change reported so far a full interview : link
places you can safely store your items include any houses you buy , your companion ( s ) , and your horse . places considered to be owned by you ( and therefore contain safe containers ) are ( spoiler warning ) : arch-mage quarters ( after you become arch-mage ) the dawnstar dark brotherhood sanctuary ( after you have finished the dark brotherhood quest line ) i have personally stored items in my apprentice quarters in the college of winterhold without problems , however others have had stuff go missing from there , so be careful . other containers may not be safe . given what some other answers have said , gerder 's house does not seem like a safe place for long-term storage .
you can get backup . . . as soon as you know traut 's location you can talk to dethmold . he will give you 4 of his soldiers as backup . so , when you then go to fight traut , you just have to open the middle door in the room , there the 4 soldiers are waiting to help you in the fight .
you can get a tank ( aka , rhino ) in many ways . . . a ) without wanted level - you can purchase it , and it will spawn in a hangar in the airfield b ) with wanted level - you can find one in the military base , but that can be hard to get into . i suggest getting a fast car with franklin , then using his special abilities to bust through the gate because your wanted level will not go up while you are in the special ability . that will save you some time to get closer before all hell breaks loose . you can find a tutorial here to get the tank i am sure there will also be a cheat soon figured out that would allow you to spawn them , but i do not think it has been confirmed yet . bonus : here is some gameplay footage of the tank
the monkey apprentice 's whirlwind and tempest tornado upgrades blow balloons back . many other upgrades have a short stun - ninja monkey and bomb tower upgrades , to name a few .
quick version if you bought it through steam , check the downloadable content ( dlc ) option from the in-game menu to confirm it is authorized for you ( it should be ) . in that case just start playing and it will download while you are in-game . note : my first character did not get the starting bonuses at the beginning ( golden guns and eridian artifact ) since the dlc was not loaded immediately on launch , though they showed up later . my second character did get the bonuses from the start . details when i first started the game this morning i checked for dlc in the in-game menu . it listed " borderlands 2 premiere club " as purchased but not downloaded . steam also showed it as purchased : from the game library right-click borderlands 2 and choose view downloadable content . after hunting around for a while in b2 and steam looking for a way to install it i decided to just start playing . now it shows as purchased an installed , and while playing i was notified via pop-up that i have the golden key . so apparently it installed itself while i played . i did not need an activation key ; i purchased it through steam a couple of days before launch . also , in steam i now have two entries : borderlands 2 , and borderlands 2 premiere club . this is the same way steam dlc has worked for me in the past . how to get the starting bonuses my first character did not get the two starting bonuses initially : a class-specific eridian artifact and a set of golden guns . later in the game they showed up , though by that time the golden guns were no longer valuable ( the artifact is still good ) . this happened because the premiere club dlc was still downloading at the time i started my first character . if you want to be sure of getting the bonuses either : create a temporary dummy character , wait for the premiere club dlc to install , then create your " real " character ; or wait at the in-game menu until the dlc installs before creating your character . fair warning : i am not sure option 2 works since my process was different , but it is worth a try if you do not want to create a temporary character .
routers are , in my experience , your best bet here , you can configure one router to pull the scrap out ( set the router to extract from a side ) , and one router to insert the required items ( insert into top ) . this way you need one export/level emitter per type , up to a maximum of 4 per router ( technically you can add more per router , but it is messy ) . if you want more than 4 types of items you can add another router set to insert at top without problems . this setup would also be easier to expand as you would just need to run ic2 power further and add the block next to the existing system .

note that eliza will always warn you before the boss uncloaks to charge you in melee . try to position yourself around one of the large power cells around the room . when the boss uncloaks to charge you , place yourself between her and the cell , and she will charge the cell , take damage , and be temporarily disabled ( i have found that the easiest way on the hardest difficulty to do this is to jump over her as she charges , but i am not sure if this is possible without the cybernetic leg prosthesis ) . feel free to squeeze off a few head-shots with your weapon of choice while she is incapacitated if you have the electricity-shield upgrade on your dermal armor ; otherwise , jump like a bunny on crack if the electricity damages you to avoid taking the full amount of damage . to my knowledge , there is no immediate " safe " place to hide from the electricity damage , but i could be wrong here . if she still has some health left after charging all four cells , a fairly easy way to get some decent damage in is to stun her with your stun gun or emp grenades and shoot her a few times with your weapon of choice . then run . run like demon monkeys are after you and hide like a scared npc . you can also " see " her while she is cloaked if you have the smart vision augmentation ; this comes in handy to either plan surprise attacks or get to a safer location , as the boss moves quite slowly while cloaked , even on the hardest difficulty .
you will need to obtain the summon spell from your paladin trainer at level 20 . at level 40 you can get your next mount in the same way at your paladin trainer .
as far as i know , what you mention about " belly of the beast " is incorrect . this mission does not require tosh . thus , you can feel free to pick tosh or nova without affecting any of your later mission choices . tosh does not participate in belly of the beast even if you do have him . the mission consists of raynor , tychus , swann , and stettman only . that said , there is a strategy that can be found here that relies on using ghosts specifically for the final mission , all-in . that strategy can be found here . thus , if you want to try that , you had need to choose nova . other than that , your choice will not affect any future choices in the campaign , except for of course which flavor of cloaked ground unit you prefer most , in the event you actually even make spectres/ghosts at all . the two abilities that differ are : snipe ( ignores armor ) for ghosts and ultrasonic pulse for spectres ( aoe stun attack ) .
you must first adopt a puppy before you can adopt any kittens . kittens cannot walk or participate in competitions . if let loose in your room they may find surprising treats , but without money coming in from walks and competitions , you might find yourself low on money . this would limit the amount of toys and other purchases you could make in game .
i have had this problem occur a few times during my first play-through . i was able to get around it by closing the item menu and re-opening . sometimes it took several ( 5 or more ) attempts before i could properly scroll through to the item i wanted , but it did eventually work .
the only possibility in my mind is command groups . at a previous time , he selected a batch of probes , held shift or ctrl and pressed a number , 1 - 0 ( number row only , not keypad ) . when looking elsewhere , all you have to do is press the assigned number in order to recall that selection . holding shift+# adds the currently selected units to the selected command group . holding ctrl+# creates the currently selected units in the selected command group . shift = additive ctrl = replace
yeah , this can happen and it can be managed . is the players a recent acquisition ? new signings often have a bedding-in period where they adjust to new training , facilities , coaches and the demands of changing clubs/country etc etc . normally this resolves by itself and the stats jump back up within a month or two , unless the player is really struggling to settle . the other option here is to check that the training is actually beneficial for the player , which brings me on to the next ( and probably most pertinent ) question : have you put some thought into their training ? players respond differently to training and this is to do with many factors such as age , current attributes , determination , hidden attribs , personality . the most important is usually personality ( which encompasses hidden attributes ) . this could be a very long answer but to keep it concise , make sure the training scheme suits the player . some prefer hard training , others a little less . balance it with their playing load . some also prefer focus sessions , others not so much . some players will always whinge about training , this is due to a ' bad ' personality . note that real players will never report as having ' negative ' personalities , balanced is as ' low ' as they will go . is the player jaded ? this is usually the killer and is notoriously difficult to appreciate and then manage in fm . if you are a way through the season and the player has played a large number of games then they are probably jaded which leads to decreased playing and training performance and hence , lowering attributes . manage tired/jaded players very carefully , some need a kick in the butt but most require rest , managing their playing load and rotating them . is the player at an attribute boundary ? whilst the game reports 1-20 the actual underlying attributes are finer than this . 12.4 reports as 12 , 12.6 reports as 13 due to rounding ( it is 0-200 under the hood with 55 extra for other stuff , do not worry about it ) . sometimes many of their attributes are around this boundary and you can see a seesaw/flipping effect where the attribute deviates by a tiny amount but the game reports as a change in attribute ( which it is but its not as bad as you may think ) . do not worry about it and in time it will resolve up or down depending on whether the player is trending towards improvement/decline . what can i do about it ? first port of call is to make sure your training is spot on . this can be easily changed and a little player interaction normally reports on it . next make sure your facilities are up to scratch . hard to solve if they are not and takes time . coaches any good ? if they are rubbish you can expect players to decline . normally you can interact with a player and tell them their training isnt good enough . you have to be careful but this normally sorts players out . do not do it to players you need who will get annoyed and want to leave ( do you really need that sort of player anyway though ? ) and be careful doing it to tired and jaded players . any player with a decent amount of determination and professionalism normally responds well .
note : before making *any* changes inside the wtf folder in your world of warcraft folder , always back it up . as you mention , the way each addon implements this is really inconsistent . basically , it breaks down as follows : some addons use a framework ( for example ace ) that allow settings to be easily transferred between characters - with these addons it is usually just a case of loading the addon 's config page and selecting the profile to use . other addons will store settings at realm level . the settings for these addons should be easily visible across all characters on the same realm , again by opening up the configuration page for the addon . these settings are stored in the WTF\Account\&lt;account id&gt;\Realm Name folder if you want to copy them between realms , keeping in mind that if your character ( s ) on the additional realm are not named the same , you will probably still have to export the settings from the addon and reimport them . many addons will store settings at the character level . these settings are invisible to each of your characters across multiple networks . these settings are stored in the WTF\Account\&lt;account id&gt;\Realm Name\Character Name folder . if you want to copy them between characters , you can simply copy the files from one character to the other . keep in mind that this will not always work in all instances and with all addons , and for the instances that it does not work , it will normally reset the settings your addons are already using on the account you overwrote . normally the most effective and consistent way to move settings between characters/realms is to open up the configuration page for each addon and use the addon 's " export " or " save settings " function . this should output the settings for the addon to a file which can then be re-imported on the other character ( s ) .
character level does not influence the level of dropped plans , it might influence what plans drop , but a plan for archon spaulders of strength is always going to be a level 60 item . this goes for all dropped recipes . if the resulting item is a legendary , a set ( basically a subclass from legendaries ) or a rare does not matter . the crafted items will also always be crafted at the same level regardless of what level the character crafting them is . a lvl 1 character can craft lvl 70 items .
using hamachi , here 's how i solved the problem . briefly : join a hamachi network on both computers hit open to lan on one ( the host ) join hamachi-ip:port in direct connect minecraft option , where port is the port listed by the host minecraft when you hit open to lan , and the ip is the hamachi ip of the host device .
picks turn up commonly in and around mines - look for the crossed hammer icon on the maps ( shown here ) : how do i find an ore mine ? you will also see them in some of the shops in the villages .
the are not . you get the same proc chance regardless of your weapon speed . check out http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/thread-13842.html , they have a discussion about stunlocking monsters . do note that crowd-control effects on bosses do not last as long , and on higher difficulties even normal monsters are more resilient to crowd-control .
i actually find slowing/snaring them down more effective as it lasts and lets you run to position yourself to chase them into a corner . i have tried this quite a few times , works really well because once they are in the corner you can start dealing constant dps towards the fiend itself because all they will do is try to get into you ( and they cant run further than that corner they have cornered themselves into ) . for wide open areas , you could always try to nuke them ( if your damage is high enough ) and acquire a fast kill before they run into a mob of monsters or champions . also , you could clear the entire area around the goblin out first before trying to take it ( the goblin ) out , also improves your chances of killing it that way . ( i do this on inferno so that i do not actually have my butt kissed by mobs of monsters or champions while i am trying to nuke that sneaky running bastard ) if you are talking about confusion/knockback/etc , i wouldnt recommend it as confusion ( although it lasts only a while , only serves to make the goblin run away from you - which is what it exactly does even when not confused ) , while knockback pushes the goblin away , which is not exactly what you want . you want to have a skill that allows you to catch up with the goblin and position yourself into a place where it will run into a corner or at least not into a fresh group of mobs ( that is the basic idea , unless you are playing on a very easy mode ) . also , for the amount of reward that a goblin can give you , treading carefully and making a very precise action plan would actually be quite rewarding at times . so yeah , its hard , sometimes confusing , but if you perfect a plan you will be laughing all the way to your stash . :p
yes , you can transport horses through the nether . i have successfully transported horses from one base to another via paths through the nether , avoiding oceans , so i know they can go through the gate . it is a little tricky getting them through ; for whatever reason , i found that when handling several horses , they would avoid going through the direction i was pushing them but easily wander back out of the nether on their own . pretty sure that is a quirk of randomness , but you will want to have leads and fenceposts handy so you can immediately confine them far enough away from the portal that they do not walk back out . i play in multiplayer primarily , so i found it handy to have one person behind the horses pushing and one person in the nether grabbing them with leads . the leads will break when you and your horse are in opposite dimensions , so it is not exactly trivial to go through . they will not go through while being ridden , so you have to make do with pushing and pulling . i ran a test just now ; horses are definitely affected by soul-sand . splash potions of slowness are a lot less effective : i could hardly tell a difference in horse speed , but the particle effect indicated the horse was being affected by the potion . they also have trouble with one-block-wide tunnels and even two-block-wide tunnels sometimes , particularly around corners , so it is recommended you carve a three-wide , three- or four-tall path for riding in the nether .
after you have beaten the dark brotherhood quest line , buy the torture room and keep attacking the people chained up in there . once their health is low , use healing hands and heal them . i have level 100 in restoration and destruction .
no . the amount of cookies gained from popping a wrinkler is not affected by the multipliers ( or , for that matter , the clotting ) , or the " click frenzy ( x777 ) " ones that can also appear . the number of cookies leeched by the wrinkler ( and thus returned when popped ) is , however , affected by these multipliers .
have you looked into powerline networking ? assuming your router and xbox are on the same mains circuit in your house , then that should be able to get a wired connection between your rooms without having to mess about laying new wiring . it is also generally better bandwidth and latency than a wireless solution ( though not quite up with proper wired ethernet kit ) . lots of companies do it these days , a quick amazon listing for powerline networking kit has a whole list of them .
completionist is probably be closest term you will get as they generally will get every single possible thing done within said game . it does not matter if it is an achievement or not , they will get everything . this includes flavour text for displays and purchasing collectors editions just to get the bonus items .
so there are only three factors which influence muta vs muta battles . they are , in order of importance : army size keeping wounded muta alive focus firing a lot of people will try to tell you that the bounce is important , but bounce has a range of 3 ( identical to the muta itself ) so once you get above 8-10 mutalisks , reducing bounce damage is not practical . army size is the most important part of any mutalisk on mutalisk contest , but not just having more than your opponent . at about 14 mutalisk , they gain the ability to one shot opposing mutalisks . above this point , having all your mutas target a single target actually results in a loss of damage . unlike the siege tank , mutalisk damage is carried by a projectile , so if the target dies before it hits , the projectile does not re-target . thus if you have more than 14 mutalisks , the best thing you can do is split them into groups of 14 and micro them independently . as army size is important , keeping your mutalisks alive is almost as important . this means backing out mutalisks who have low hit point values . because of the nature of the glaive worm bounce , this means you are going to have to pull wounded muta back prior to getting low health ( think about half ) . ideally you want your opponents mutalisks to follow this unit , as mutalisks have to decelerate on attacking . this means chasing mutalisks will never catch up , and become easier prey . if they do not chase then you need that muta to almost immediately get back into the fray ( the technique for this i will describe in a second ) . focus firing is usually a well understood concept by most players , but how it applies to mutalisks is often unique . ideally you want to attack the nearest opposing muta and then shift target his remaining mutalisks from closest to furthest . however , mutalisks are very quick and have the useful property that they bunch up very tightly when micro'd . you will want to use this to your advantage to prevent your opponent from focus firing your muta down . as mutalisks attack they will spread out a little , so you will have to use the time in between attacks ( yeah the 1.5 game seconds ) , to tighten them back up . this will usually require more than one action . make sure to hit Hold Position in between movements . while this will not function as advertised , it will make sure your muta do not waiting to fire while moving . finally , as mentioned before do not allow you focus-firing muta to chase after an opposing mutalisk as this will leave you open to assault . while muta on muta micro may sound intense , the period for which it matters is usually very small . as the most important aspect is army size , you should gain a slight advantage through better micro early on , which will quickly snowball . if you find yourself behind at some point , do not remain and fight , but rather quickly exit .
much like world of warcraft 's launcher , " playable " means the launcher has downloaded sufficient game code and initial media for you to launch the game and start playing it . unlike " available " where you run into " loading walls " where the game client struggles to keep up with downloading media necessary for you to play , " playable " means it has downloaded enough data for you to play without hitting any " loading walls " . setup ( red ) : core game content is being prepared . you cannot enter the game at this time . available ( yellow ) : major game content is not completely applied . you can play , but your game experience will not be ideal . playable ( green ) : final game content is almost complete . you may experience a few issues with playing at this stage . the " playable " includes high resolution textures and other low priority flair : q . how is data assigned to each stage ? a . data is assigned to each stage based on the relative need for that data . red is required to get into the game , yellow is data needed for baseline gameplay , and green is for variants of base game data ( higher-resolution graphics , alternate sounds , other flavor data ) . [ 1 ] therefore , " optimal " means it has completed downloading all available content and will not impact your play experience with background downloads . ( information is from world of warcraft 's launcher , which uses the same technology )
it turns out that the problem was that ian was standing in front of the door trying to get to me , which stopped the guard from leaving . moving over to the other part of the shop caused ian to move out of the way , which fixed everything ( i robbed killian blind anyway ) . he did not move the first time i went over there , so it may be that you need to save and reload the game a few times to make it happen .
i completed single player on heroic last night , and the scene in question does not take place . a few similar scenes do take place : didact does hold the chief aloft ( with the force i guess ) a few times with his arms held out . once when you first release him and again at the climax of the story . there are no flash backs to the chief childhood . a promethean kight also does the ' jump on you head split open scream thing ' when you first encounter them on requiem .
it is particularly dangerous , but if you are really hurting for more health , you could try exploring the dungeon without killing skeletron ( assuming you can not , if you are low on health ) . it is reasonably easy to avoid the skeletron heads that spawn if you continue falling down further into the dungeon - just take out your hammer and head down , breaking any hearts you find until you die . i found a good 3-4 hearts before i was killed , and i was not trying very hard to stay alive .
i have never liked the shivs personally , as they cost more to research/build/setup than a human soldier , along with the other downsides you have mentioned . i would much rather bring a rookie/squaddie ( or otherwise underleveled soldier ) along for the ride than a shiv if i have the choice . the investment i would make in a shiv i would rather make in gear or other base improvements . a properly equipped soldier will beat a shiv hands down in terms of versatility and firepower . even if the squaddie dies , i get to keep his gear , although the destruction of a shiv is a loss of all the cash/resources invested . however , i think the root problem here is that you are losing scouts frequently . stop doing that , and you will be much better off . i explained my strategy in this answer , but the general gist in this situation follows . if you do not know where aliens are , cycle through your squad until you have got your scout selected . use the scout to look for aliens in the first half-move of your scout 's turn . if you find them , have the scout retreat and set up an overwatch ambush with the rest of your team . if you do not find them , move everyone up using half-moves , and set up a perimeter with overwatch and wait out the enemy turn . your scouts should generally never engage directly . ( there are exceptions and caveats - for instance , on a terror mission where you need to move quickly , you might opt to be a bit more aggressive . if you have got all the time in the world , though , use it . ) when you find aliens , you are generally outnumbered - your one soldier discovers a group of usually at least 3 . the aliens then get a " free move " to set up defensively to react to your position . this puts you at a disadvantage , and you can not afford disadvantages .
just make sure there is at least a 1025 blocks distance between your overworld portals : likelihood of 2 overworld portals linking to the same nether portal - normal world portals that are within 1024 distance of each other on either x or z axis are almost always going to link to the same nether realm portal on initial construction because 1024 translates to a distance of 128 in the nether realm , and the game checks for existing portals within 128 " radius " around the destination ( the 257x257x128 box ) . ( minecraft wiki ) you should also note that , in smp prior to 1.6 , portals were bugged for quite some time and needed server mods like bukkit in order to work . ask your admins/operators , there may still be some bukkit plugin running on your server handling the nether .
i am not sure what hp10pl is , but : ad - attack damage - the stat that directly affects melee auto-attack damage . many melee/fighter/tank champions will want to get ad gear to increase their damage . ap - ability power - the stat that directly affects ability damage . many mage/ranged champions will want to get ap gear to increase their damage . arpen - armor penetration - makes your ad attacks ignore some amount of the enemy 's armor when they hit . as - attack speed - the speed in which you attack with normal attacks ( not spells ) . ad champions benefit from this . b - 1 . back ; 2 . baron - 1 . to signify that you are going to recall into your base or otherwise retreat ; named either for the word " back " or for the fact that by default , pressing b initiates recall . 2 . refers to baron nashor , the boss monster who spawns at 15 minutes and is found near the top lane on summoner 's rift . blue - blue buff on summoner 's rift , from the ancient golem . provides scaling cdr and bonus mana/energy regen . bot - generally refers to the bottom lane in summoner 's rift and twisted treeline , or the champions who are laning there . e.g. , " bot mia " = " the enemy champions in bot lane are missing , beware . " on dominion , this refers to the lower-left or lower-right capture points , as well as the bottom lane in general . carry - heroes , usually ad heroes , capable of dealing massive damage and taking down entire groups , but usually die themselves easily too ( they " carry " the entire team for the damage ) cc - crowd control , which refers to abilities that restrict a champions ability to act or move , such as slows and stuns . cdr - cooldown reduction - the more % , the quicker the cooldown on spells is over ( a maximum of 40% ) . usually good for casters or heroes without mana . cs - creep score - the count of the number of creeps minions you have killed . higher number means you have been better at last hitting , and have more gold to spend . dive - tower diving , the fact of attacking an enemy under his tower , usually to deal a killing blow on a low-health champion . doing so makes the tower attack the diver , making it a risky move . drag - dragon - the boss creep near bottom lane on summoner 's rift . gank - to gang up on an enemy champion by surprise and kill him/her . gp10 - gold per 10 seconds . how much gold you generate per 10 seconds , by items , runes or masteries . useful for support champions . hard leash ( red/blue ) - same as a normal leash ( see below ) , but leaving the monster with very little health ( around ~10% ) and the jungler finishes the monster without using smite ( usually to save it for the other buff since he will not be receiving help this time ) . imo - in my opinion , sometimes imho - in my humble opinion . this is a common abbreviation across the web , and is not limited to online games . ks - kill steal - when someone finishes an enemy , but other teammate wanted to perform . leash ( red/blue ) - helping the jungler with a neutral monster until the monster is at ~30-40% of health at the beginning of a game , so that the jungler can use smite to finish it ( usually people leave the area so that the jungler gets all the experience ) . mia - missing in action - means that the enemy in your lane ( or the specific enemy you mention ) is no longer visible in your lane , and may be on his way to " gank " a teammate . everyone should be careful and watch out for the missing champion . also used : " miss " or " ss " mid - refers to mid-lane in summoner 's rift , or the middle level of capture nodes in dominion . mm - matchmaking - the system in lol that teams up people/puts them against each other . mp5 ( aka mp/5 ) - mana per 5 seconds - a stat referring to how much mana your champion recovers every 5 seconds . mpen - magic penetration - makes your magical attacks ignore some amount of the enemy 's magic resistance when they hit . proc - refers to an item 's or an abilities ' activation due to some other action , usually but not always a basic attack . examples include phage 's move speed buff ( basic attack ) , vel'koz ' passive ( spell damage ) , vi 's denting blows ( both basic attacks and spell damage ) , caitlyn 's headshot , etc . pull ( red/blue/drake ) - the fact of hitting a neutral monster , usually at range , so that it will follow you for a few seconds , allowing another champion to attack it without getting damage . you will find this typically at the beginning of the game , with the carry pulling the golem/lizard for the jungler . as of season 3 , this no longer works on red or blue . red - red buff on summoner 's rift , from the lizard elder . scaling damage over time and slow . sr - summoners rift ( 5v5 map ) - the most played map , the classic dota 5v5 . has 3 lanes , the dragon mob and the boss nashor . also : " rift " top - top lane in summoner 's rift/twisted treeline , or the upper-left/upper-right capture points in dominion . tt - twisted treeline ( 3v3 map ) - the smaller map for 6 players , has 2 lanes . tp - teleport - summoner 's spell
when your follower " dies " , they enter a pre-death state that generally allows them to come back to full health immediately after battle . however , if they continue to take more damage after entering that state , they will die permanently . if there is a chance your follower is still alive but nowhere to be seen ( for example , if they entered the pre-death state and you ran off , thinking they were dead dead ) , fast traveling to a location should cause the follower to appear back at your side . if fast traveling still does not produce your follower , they are almost certainly fully dead . you can confirm this by trying to pick up another follower : if they agree to come with you , the other follower has ceased to be . sorry about that . the only thing you can do at this point—if you are not keen on loading up an earlier save or using console commands—is to find where your follower died and loot their corpse . if you are amenable to using the console , generally you still need to find where your follower died to ressurrect them : when you do , open the console , target their corpse , and type : resurrect 1  and press enter . however , you can get around even this restriction by selecting the follower by using the prid command anywhere : prid &lt;RefId&gt;  where &lt;RefId&gt; is the id corresponding to the follower , found by using the creation kit or by looking up the follower on uesp . once the follower 's selected , use the resurrect command mentioned above .
i just tried all the options in the options menu and it appears to be impossible . and i agree with you , when i first started playing the campaign it irked me a bit that the scores kept loitering on my screen . it is unfortunate , but what can you expect from ea :/
make sure you have version 0.2 of the mod or higher . i had the same problem until i found the latest version of the got mod .
dude i have been searching for hours . i have went through the savegame code file and nothing . i have searched that for " house " for " key " and for " false " and checked every single one and nothing was a match to it . my only conclusion so far is that there is no way to open this door . i am gonna run through the source code now to see if there is anything about that or the hidden commands that the computer tells us about and i will edit this later . edit found in the code : Village.prototype.goToFirstHouse = function () { alert("yay"); };  while the other houses call for a function named setplace this.getGame().setPlace(new SecondHouse(this.getGame()));  the first house only does an alert . which means there is nothing there and even if we managed to ' enter ' the first house we had only get an alert saying " yay " , nothing else . so there is nothing in the first house 8d
i have been having really good luck with kill confirmed . you get xp for kills , plus for their tags , plus if you can find a ) other tags from friendly kills or b ) red tags from enemy kills you will also get xp . a really good thing to try and do is to go back and get your own tags after your killed , it is a +250 xp bump .
here 's how it appears to work start by spawning zombies at buildings ( day 1 ) for every night , for every tile : for every neighboring tile with zombies , there is a chance of one more zombie spawning for every two zombies killed in this tile , there is a chance of another one dying by despair . if the total number of zombies drops below 2 × map side × day number , spawn more zombies . ( a 12×12 map has side 12 . ) we are testing a spreadsheet ( live link ) that puts these rules in practice in itching plantation of shadows . time will tell .
edit : thanks ! i tried to improve this answer with a few more examples . do not hesitate to give feedback . rule #1: player skills over champion matchup . do not pick a champion you do not feel confident with , just because it should counter your opponent . ( unless you want to practise , of course . ) rule #2: do not blindly trust lolcounter . why should you ? rule #3: every single patch makes part of lolcounter outdated . perhaps you should not trust it at all . rule #4: if you want , or need to rely on it , detailed and up-to-date comments and debates are worth infinitely more than votes . frustrated players who lost their lane can , and will vote regardless of whether they have been countered or not . tl ; dr most votes are unreliable . that being said . . . there are indeed game mechanics that favor some champions in a given matchup . a few examples : ryze can root ( w , " arcane prison" ) an opponent before damaging him . kennen 's " woohoo " sprint ( e , " lightning dash" ) makes him unable to do anything except moving fast , and that is his main farming tool . therefore , farming with lightning dash in front of ryze is almost impossible . short-ranged champions with no gap-closing abilities , e.g. udyr or ryze ( yes , he has ranged attacks , but his range is shorter than most ap carries ) are weak to kiting . ashe counters udyr ( he can never reach her ) and cassiopeia counters ryze ( she can harass him with q forever while never entering his casting range ) . among ad carries , caitlyn counters vayne for the same reason , even though it is less obvious . some champions have silencing abilities . they tend to fare better against casters , who rely on casting spells to deal damage . jax can dodge basic attacks during his majorette stance ( e , " counter strike" ) . that gives him an edge over champions who mostly rely on basic attacks , e.g. ad carries , tryndamere , ad master yi , etc . lee sin has two abilities revealing stealthed champions ( q , " sonic wave " , and e , " tempest" ) , i.e. he counters wukong , akali , etc . kennen 's and fiddlesticks ' ultimates ( "slicing maelstorm " and " crowstorm" ) are area spells that follow them and deal damage over time around them . which means they will be wasted if the caster is blown away from the fight . janna 's ultimate ( "monsoon" ) is perfect for this ; she is a famous counter to kennen and fiddlesticks in team fights only . other champions with knock-back abilities : alistar , jayce , gragas , lee sin and tristana . katarina 's ultimate ( "death lotus" ) deals huge damage over 2 seconds around her . however , this is a channeled ability . any crowd-control ability will stop it . three out of blitzcrank 's four abilities can interrupt death lotus , especially his ultimate ( "static field" ) , which is an instant and very safe way to disable katarina . she cannot hope to land her ultimate in the middle of blitzcrank 's team . poppy 's passive ability ( "valiant fighter" ) reduces by half the damage taken from heavy hits ( more than 10% of her current health ) . it makes her highly resilient to spike damage , such as veigar 's spells . however , she is very weak to damage-over-time spells ( which are almost never affected ) and true damage ( which cannot be mitigated ) . teemo , darius and olaf counter poppy in top lane . some of malphite 's and rammus ' abilities benefit from armor ( "spiked shell " , " defensive ball curl " and " ground slam" ) . they are more efficient against teams that rely a lot on physical damage . on the other hand , 50% of galio 's magic resistance is added to his ap ( "runic skin" ) ; therefore , he is better against teams that rely on magic damage . " yorick walks into a bar . . . there is no counter . " ( this is wrong , yet almost true , but i love this joke . cho'gath , nasus and trundle may benefit from yorick 's ghouls . ) these are only examples . they might even become outdated someday . however , what truly matters is the understanding of game mechanics that leads to these examples . always ask yourself " what makes this champion strong ? what would stop it in its tracks ? " . bottom line : be your own lolcounter .
you have a couple of options here . if you have the spell of knock or a wand of opening , you can unlock the door without angering the watch . if you can obtain a key and you have not already been warned by the watch , then you can apply it on the door to unlock it , and you should only get a warning . as sconibulus pointed out , you can just wait for the watch to be out of sight and then kick down the door as you normally would . the watch only goes after you if they see you do something they do not like . finally , you can use your wand of digging or a pickaxe to go down a floor , and if you do it when your kitten is next to you , then it will just follow you down as though you had gone down the stairs with it . if your kitten is too far away to follow , you can just return by the up-stair on that floor and kick the door open from the inside . this should not present a problem with the watch because none of them can see you do it , and you will be reunited with your kitten .
the system is levelled - you will not find hugely difficult things you cannot beat . except giants . actions that level up skills : attacking someone with a weapon casting a spell on someone or something ( things like clairvoyance do nothing ) sneaking and not being seen in the presence of enemies opening a lock - seems breaking a lockpick also gives skill xp picking a pocket buying or selling something . successfully persuading/intimidating someone ( i think ) training some quest rewards ( finding the anden family sword gives you +1h and +block ) creating a piece of armour or a weapon enchanting/disenchanting something taking damage whilst wearing armour making a potion or a poison the list is not exhaustive , though .

when you knock off a goliath 's helmet and the little terrifying david lynch head comes out , they go berserk and attack everyone . they level up by killing their former allies . upon killing enemies , the goliath will gain experience points and gain levels , becoming even more dangerous . a beneficial aspect of this is that the dropped loot will be better . at the god ith level , drops are greatly increased . an easy way to tell whether or not you have gotten it to a high enough level for the " goliath , meet david " achievement is if the goliath has god in its name .
the sas module is designed to keep your craft on its current course by means of altering fins and micro-rockets . you should turn the sas off while you maneuver your craft onto the desired heading , then turn it back on to have it automatically stay on that heading . if you find the sas is not staying on course , you may need to make your craft more maneuverable with the addition of extra fins or micro-rockets .
minecraft officially supports ascii characters under 0x80 . it can render more characters , but they do not render correctly . the supported characters are listed below . you can find this list together with more info about the possibilities ( colors , and style ) of the chat at the chat article on the minecraftcoalition wiki , if figuring out what these characters are is too much trouble .
starbound is from a different developer , only @tiyuri worked on both games . starbound is quite similar to terraria , but there are a few key differences such as races and the fact that the world does not end , it wraps around ( planets are round , you can walk in one direction and end up where you started ) . starbound is not a sequel , but many people call it a spiritual successor to terraria . the gameplay is similar , and the key differences come from starbound 's questing , spaceships and the ability to travel between planets within the game . this is extremely useful for public multiplayer servers , who do not need to worry about players stealing from others anymore and most random people are unlikely to even see each other by chance . other than that , most mechanics are just the same old polished up a bit with a new look .
nope , you should be fine . the only damage they cause is to enemy troops .
from your description it sounds like you are most concerned with testing the contents of a hopper that is filling a minecart ( either a chest minecart or a hopper minecart ) and performing an action based on its empty or full state . this is good because it is quite easy to test , as opposed to testing the contents of the cart itself . since you mention in a comment that you are basically building off of my previous design , but adding an automatic option to send the minecart instead of pressing a button , i will show you how to modify it accordingly : after adding a hopper above the cart , add a comparator which powers a redstone torch . this will turn on when the hopper empties . this signal then powers a rising edge detector circuit that consists of a dropper feeding another hopper , which in turn feeds back into the dropper . place a single item in the dropper . a comparator tests the contents of the hopper , and a repeater feeds the signal into the powered rail . whenever the feeding hopper empties , the rail powers and sends the cart along .
the drive is separate from your account , and the ps3 backup is not reliant on ps+ subscription . you do not lose anything owned by your account by deleting it from your ps3 . if your backup fails , try deleting unnecessary files like game install data ( under game data utility on the game category on the xmb ) , i had a problem when install data for one game was corrupted and this may fail a backup . when all else fails , backup all of your saves to the cloud backup then replace your old drive with the new drive and restore all the saves to it . you will need to redownload all of the full games , demos , game patches , dlc and reinstall disc based games in order to play them again , though , and you will lose the current themes on your system and all the non-game media ( movies , pictures , music ) .
the best answers for optimal plays can usually be found in the elitist jerks forums , because they do a lot of testing and maths to confirm their recommendations . on dot refreshing , they say : compared to wlk , our dot 's are far stronger now . you want to do your best to maintain very high uptime on both of them . typically , the only time you will hold up recasting of a dot is if it falls off and the corresponding eclipse is coming up very soon--you will wait one or two casts and refresh at the beginning of eclipse . if both dot 's are coming up at around the same time when you start eclipse , remember that nature 's grace will only affect the second one , so you want to remember to use insect swarm first ( because moonfire/sunfire is stronger than is under either eclipse ) . cataclysm changed the way dot refreshing works--when you refresh a currently ticking dot , you no longer waste a partial tick . significantly , if you refresh a dot when it has only one tick remaining , there is no loss at all . this means the optimal time to refresh a dot is during its last tick , thereby maintaining true 100% uptime . failing that , refresh at the same time you do now , as soon at it falls off . note : since moonfire and sunfire are two different debuffs , we can not benefit from the new dot system when replacing one with the other . in that case you should wait for the old moonfire/sunfire to fall off . dot ticks use your spellpower , haste , and +% damage ( e . g . eclipse ) values from the moment the dot was cast--they do not update in real time until the next time you cast the dot . crit chance of the ticks , on the other hand , does change dynamically if you gain or lose crit buffs while the dot is ticking . because the entire dot is effected by your stats at the moment of cast , there can be detailed decisionmaking in when to apply them--see " advanced points " below for more . from http://elitistjerks.com/f73/t110353-balance_cataclysm_4_3_dragon_soul/#dot_refreshing
flash and teleport are forbidden ( for evident reasons ) , all the others ( including ghost ) are allowed . basically , you can not cast anything teleporting you nor trigger an action that uses your tail ( as it is used by ulti ) , these actions include auto-attacks and e .
i am not sure ( only got one gaming pc so can not test ) , but i guess it has to do with the size of skyrim savegames ( they are rather huge ) . i would suggest - as you probably want an immediate solution - to simply use the old fashioned way : copy the files yourself . you do not have to worry about inconsistent cloud states ( like overwriting newer saves by accident ) , because the file names are unique ( just make sure to create a new savegame once you have played ) . just copy the savegames you need from your desktop pc to your laptop . you can find the files in the following folder ( just create it , if it does not exist ) : My Documents > My Games > Skyrim > Saves the file names should be the same as they are in the game , with an attached .ess file extension . pick the savegames you had like to take with you and copy them to the same location on your laptop . once you are back home , do the same in reverse . also , you can remove old save games by simply removing them from that directory ( e . g . deleting them or moving them to a backup drive with more space ) .
the basic principle of starting minecarts with powered rails is that the minecart needs to " know which way to go " . by this , i mean there must only be one possible way for the minecart to move . a sloped powered rail works because the minecart knows to move downhill . another way to do this without sloping the rail is to put a solid block on one side of the powered rail . by doing this , the minecart should start moving the other way when the rail is powered .
nevermore is actually one of the more powerful heroes there are a couple things you should know about him : staying alive : nevermore 's damage is largely proportional to how many last hits you got since you last died . so stay alive ! you are going to need lother ( which turns your invisible ) or kelen 's ( which teleports you ) to do this , so after boots ( str or phase ) this is your first pick up . combo : because you have 3 shadowrase , you need to cast it more than once to kill . figure out the middle range usage ( hint its the same range as your basic attack ) and then follow up with short ( if he comes after you ) or long ( if he runs away ) . you can also combo it to get more kills . requim : this skill trades on being right next to your target , so combo it with lother or kelen 's for maximum effectiveness . ability build : necromasty ( to start grouping up your last hits ) shadowraze ( lvl 1 is not great , so hold off on it shadowraze ( your combo is starting to get good ) necromasty shadowraze ( by now your combo is leathal ) requim shadowraze necromasty necromasty 10+ you want to max out requim then presence of the dark lord damage : most of your early game kills revolve around shadowraze , but once you get to mid game you are going to want to pick up some dps . demons edge is very nice , as is manta style ( with bonus to survive ) . stygian is going to be essential in late game as it stacks with your presence . nevermore does not trade on his life steal , but mask of madness ' on use ability is nasty . i usually go for demon 's edge -> stygian -> buriza . if you are still looking for items after that skadi or satanic are both good , but you should be in end game by then . ok , it sounds like you have a larger problem than working well with nevermore , that extends to dota in general . a carry is a late game hero who can push a lane and take out 3-4 opposing heroes with little support . a hard carry is a character who needs to farm up all game specifically for late game . a soft carry is a player who does not have a ton of late game abilities but can become very powerful late game due to ganking . ganking is a term for going into an ally 's lane and helping to kill their enemy . this technique usually relies on surprise and coordination . ganking is useful for all heroes as nearby heroes split the xp of a kill and the last hit gains significant gold . agility based heroes usually operate as glass cannons early on , so ganking is a way to gain experience and gold with minimal risk ( the risk usually being getting ganked ) . nevermore 's ganking technique usually relies on casting shadowraze back to back . ideally you can get an ally to stun the target and there fore get off all 3 shadowraze . once you hit level 6 , if you have full necromasty use your lothar 's to get right on top of an opponent and ult . follow this up immediately with shadowraze ( remember to attack first so you are pointed in the right direction , but do not wait for the attack to go off ) . the target should be low and try to run . just dps him down till he is in range of your next shadowraze and enjoy the kill . farming is another technique to get to late game with an agility hero . nevermore is especially good at farming in his own lane ( known as laning ) because of shadowraze . adjust your range to be ideal for mid-range shadowraze ( you can do this by attacking ) . wait till the last one of your melee creeps is about to die then cast shadowraze . this should kill some of them and injure the rest . when they come into melee range your second shadowraze will finish them off . this is excellent farming technique , but very mana intensive so stock up on consumables .
the main reason shen takes so little damage in trades is because his w skill , feint , is a shield . essentially this adds to his hp every time it comes off cooldown . in order to help damage him , you can make sure to hit him as soon as his shield disappears and is on cooldown . it is a bit tricky , but manageable . damage dealt when his shield is on is reduced by the strength of his shield . another reason you might be dealing less damage than you expect is because of the damage reduction effect of his e skill , shadow dash . taunted champions deal 50% reduced damage . also , shen gains very high hp regen after hitting a unit he has marked with vorpal blade . this lets him regain health lost to harassment much quicker than most other champions . the final reason you might not be dealing as much damage as you want to is shen 's defensive items . if shen is stacking armor , then he is also going to take less physical damage . the solution to this is building armor penetration , such as last whisper or brutalizer , or simply taking more armor penetration from runes .
according to this faq , fences simply look nice . if you like how a farm looks with a fence , keep ' em around and maintain them . if you do not care , do not use ' em ! i always used them to separate parts of my farm for organizational purposes .
there are two ways i know of to create a new village : transplant villagers from an existing village : it is possible to transport villagers from an existing village , such as by placing them in a minecart , but two criteria must be met for them to stay where you unload them : they must be at least 32 blocks from the " center " of the existing village , or else they will simply return to the village . there must be homes at the new village , or else they will simply wander . the wiki discusses what constitutes a " house " and also suggests a number of designs you can use . cure some zombies : as the answer to this question indicates , zombies that spawn either in the wild or from spawners have a chance ( 10% ) of being a zombie villager , which can then be cured using a splash potion of weakness and a golden apple . if you build a village according to the links i gave above , you can then populate it with nearby randomly-spawned zombie villagers that you have cured of their zombie status .
stat allocations are based on class , and are the same across all players . unlike diablo ii , there is no input required to assign stats on level-up . it is just free stats that happen the same for everyone ! as far as i am aware , your character will always gain : +3 primary stat +2 vitality +1 to both secondary stats .
for some reason , it always starts up as if the down arrow is pressed . pressing the down button a few times when the menu is up keeps it from cycling . not a permanent fix , but at least it makes things usable .
the battle box can only be used in in infrared link battles , the battle subway , random matchup and tournaments which utilize the " battle competition " . source : http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/pok%c3%a9mon_storage_system try doing a inferred link battle and see if you can use the battle box .
i do not think there is a way to change the crew once it is been selected , unless you have a game save before you made the selection that you can revert to . i was unable to change the crew when i tried .
penetration values for ap shells are for 0-100m . after 100m , the penetration falls off . penetration values for heat ( and he ) shells are true any range . at longer ranges ( > 300m ) , you are actually getting a higher effective penetration . spgs like the su-26 are often firing at these longer ranges . note that heat and he shells are not normalized like ap/apcr shells , so heat and he are less effective against angled or sloped armor . see http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/battle_mechanics#penetration_mechanics and http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/ammo for references .
according to blizzard , there are 3 normal , 87 rare , and 39 legendary blacksmith plans . we know that the three normal ones are dropped by izual in act 4 on the respective difficulty levels . anecdotally by forum posts , it looks like people are finding one or two per difficulty ( bnet forum post ) from random monster/champion/boss drops , although one person notes none found on his way to inferno . so far the only non-blizzard list this gamer found was at d3db , and it just lists " drop " as the source of each of the plans .
the reason it is gold is because you bookmarked it through rockstar social club ; all bookmarked jobs ( missions , survival , deathmatches , races , etc . ) are highlighted in gold . if you log into your rockstar social club account , go to the gta v section , then go to " gta online " , you can find a list of your bookmarked jobs : there you can remove any bookmarked jobs . also , if you open your map and highlight that icon with your cursor , it should say " bookmarked ( job type ) " . hope this helps !
simple : because dwarf fortress does not ( as of this writing ) implement lighting . the closest thing it has is the determination of whether a tile is " inside " or " outside " , which , for light , is approximately : for each x , y position on the map : create a ray from the highest z-level and go down . if something blocks the ray then everything below that ( x , y , z ) position is dark , everything above it is light . if something is lit and then covered back up it will still count as light . there is also no day/night cycle in fortress mode , it does have a calendar system with days , months and years . in adventure mode there is a day/night cycle .
there is a train station a little distances in the direction of travel . you can see it by standing by the bottom of ladders . you can walk there . i suppose that is where the story continues .
it is in the terror tab of skills . the middle one .
no , there currently exists no way to access the ah outside of diablo 3 . from battle .netsupport documents : will there be a mobile or web-based auction house ? we are always on the lookout for opportunities to enhance the game experience and keep our community connected to our games through the web or mobile devices . however , we do not have any plans to share along those lines at this time http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/diablo-iii-auction-house-functionality#q21
this is a unique item . unique items are items that have a unique model , name , and a piece of lore at the bottom of their item description . they also have more constrained affixes ( though there is still some variation ) . a unique item is different from a legendary item , in that not all unique items are legendary , but all legendary items are unique , other than that , they are incredibly similar aside from the number of affixes . for whatever reason , the diablo 3 item database does not list these items , perhaps because they are intended to be an easter egg of some sort ( one item , the clipper , is a reference to borderlands ) , or because they have not completed the database yet . information on this item from the unofficial item database , which erroneously lists it as legendary
it seems that a drone chooses its target per random .
okay , so i looked around a bit more and it turns out there is another board you can jump to just to the left of deadgirl . you will have to get pretty close to her in order to be close enough to jump to it though . since the image below is so dark , i have highlight the important bits with colours . you can see it ( slightly ) better in the actual game .
the most important thing to note is that identifying items in one game only helps you in that game . if ruby rings were rings of invisibility last game , but you died and started a new one , you know nothing about them . the exceptions are the trivial ones : potions of water and blank scrolls/spellbooks . the second most important thing about identifying items is that each item can be blessed , uncursed , or cursed . if your role is priest , then the blessed/uncursed/cursed status is automatically revealed to you for all items . if you are of any other role , then you need to utilize alternative methods to determine the status . the available options are : you can figure out which items are which by dropping them on an altar ( as long as you are not blind , so that you can see the flashes of light ) . reading a scroll of identify will also point out the status of the item . as mentioned in durathor 's answer , pets will avoid walking on cursed items that are on the ground , only moving " reluctantly " if they ever stand on it . you can use this from the start to avoid an early demise from using cursed equipment . blessed items and uncursed items are much safer to use than cursed ones . do not drink any cursed potions , read cursed scrolls , or put on any cursed rings/armor unless you know exactly what you are doing . rings and armour conversely , if you have rings or armor that you know is not cursed , you can put it on and take it off right afterwards . for certain types of equipment ( ring of invisibility , gauntlets of dexterity , boots of levitation , etc ) this may identify it immediately . others will have clear effects , allowing you to #n ame them yourself . ( ring of conflict , gloves of fumbling , etc ) this will also tell you how heavily enchanted a piece of armor is . note that certain types of rare headgear can still cause problems , even if they are not cursed . the helm of opposite alignment will lose you all your divine protection , and will block you from doing the quest . anything that looks like a " conical hat " should be avoided unless you are a wizard , in which case you may want to wear the expensive type . potions potions provide you with some interesting options . clear potions are always water . however , they may be blessed ( holy water ) or cursed ( unholy water ) , which have important uses . you can find out what kind of water you have by dropping the potion on an altar ( they will not break , promise ) . you can try #d ipping a unicorn horn into a potion . most bad potions will be neutralized this way . if you dip a unicorn horn into a brown potion , and the brown potion clears/changes color , do not drink any brown potions . however , just because the potion did not change , does not mean it is safe to drink . unicorn horns do not detect everything . ( sleeping and acid , for example ) . also , a potion of polymorph will cause you to lose your unicorn horn as it turns into something else . this can be prevented by dipping any other item into the potion first . if you find a food shop , you can try dropping your potions there . anything that the shopkeeper offers to buy from you is a " food potion . " in practice , that means water , fruit juice , or booze . monsters will drink helpful potions ( speed , healing , invisibility ) and throw harmful potions ( paralysis , blindness , acid ) at you . when in doubt , wait for this to happen instead of drinking random potions . the penalties are much less severe , especially if the potion was cursed . if a potion was dropped by a nymph , and it is not one she stole from you , chances are that it is object detection . the potion of oil is unique in that you can a pply it to light it on fire like a lamp . no other potion is a valid target to apply . scrolls for scrolls , i typically end up relying on price . as with all items , more expensive scrolls do ' bigger ' things . some specifics on scrolls : first level of sokoban always has two scrolls of earth in the same spot . if you find a scroll in a one-square " closet " , it will be a scroll of teleportation . scrolls of identify are really cheap . cheaper than blank scrolls . this makes them pretty easy to identify . for more information , including a very detailed price id guide , see http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/id_faq.html
when you are alone put the highest resonators available right away . placing a resonator gives you 125 ap , while upgrading one gives you 65 , but only if you are not the owner of the resonator . upgrading your own resonators will give you exactly nothing , zero , nil . this means that with a friend you will get more ap by starting with low-level resonators and gradually upgrading them . also you have to remember the limits on resonators ' deployment that depends on your level . anyway you can always check how many ap you get by looking at the log in your scanner .
here 's an elaborate solution involving trapping a skeleton that appears to work well . it seems that this setup could easily be changed to use a snowball/arrow dispenser instead of a skeleton , however the business of keeping it fueled , and firing at the right time would be an issue .
some of the most popular genocides are : liches ( due to powerful magic like destroy armor and touch of death ) mind flayers ( due to their brain-eating attacks ) sea monsters ( due to their ability to drown - a 1-turn kill ) rust monsters and disenchanters ( due to them weakening weapons and armor ) when you have a scroll of genocide , you should consider waiting to bless it before you use it . a blessed scroll wipes out an entire class of monster , while an uncursed one only wipes out a single species . you may also consider cursing your scroll of genocide . this will create 4-6 monsters of the chosen species ( commonly referred to as reverse-genociding ) . this can be useful . for example , some people prefer to reverse genocide silver or grey dragons to get scales for dsm , rather than having to use a wish . others pick wraiths to eat for levels , or giants to eat for strength .
each vote gives the player an extra warzone commendation . each vote also provides you with 50 extra valor points . votes are given by players to other players based on their performance ( or whoever they feel like ) . to address mufasa 's comment/question : you can only vote for your own team . you cannot vote for yourself . again , you can only vote for your own team . sometimes the ui bugs out at the moment and you will not see the little shield icon to vote , just hit ctrl + u two times and it will reload your ui and let you vote .
apparently it is a known , and so far ignored , problem . one kind-of workaround is to set the graphics to -ultralowdetail , which for some weird reason usually solves this ( revert to normal details later , because the ultralow are really ultralow and horrible as it sounds ) . sometimes , even with higher details , if you go at one end of the screen and then another end , and do a little jump , the level starts scrolling . it is not much good , since it increases way too much startup time and frustration .
the moves you have to perform in a single combo are ( ps3 / 360 / pc ) : strike ( square / x / mouse left ) counter ( triangle / y / mouse right ) cape stun ( circle / b / mouse middle ) evade ( x / a x2 / space x2 ) throw ( square + x / a + x / shift + mouse left ) takedown ( triangle + circle / b + y / shift + mouse right ) ground takedown ( r2 + triangle / rt + y / ctrl left + mouse right ) batarang ( l1 / lt / q ) batclaw ( r2 x2 / rt x2 / c ) as far as which order and where to do it , i would check sites like true achievements ( xbox 360 ) , or ps3 trophies forums for some tips . check youtube as well , there is loads of videos for it and a bunch of different possible solutions .
no , they do not reset . what you are experiencing is a bug ( that is , as far as i know , still not fixed ) where achievements do not get transmitted to the server correctly and thus disappear again after starting a new session . for example , here 's a section from a news article about it : those users lucky enough to make it in have reported quite a number of issues . one which is drawing particular ire is the apparent loss of achievements , although responses in a blizzard forum thread on the matter suggest the servers may just be playing catch up ; the developer noted that the achievements server is getting hammered .
as it happens i was able to solve this problem because i store all of my game save files in dropbox , which i have discovered gives me the ability to undelete deleted files and directories , so while this worked for me , it is not of general usefulness . i do , however , recommend storing save files on a cloud storage platform for easy transfer between machines , backup and now for precisely this sort of situation . in the case of dropbox , it is necessary to create symbolic links from the place where windows expects the save files to be to the dropbox . to do this , one opens a command prompt window with adminstrator privileges : these instructions for windows 7/vista . everything except the " mklink " command can of course be done using the gui . directory locations may vary depending on your local setup .
as of the latest build , the quickest and most direct way to unselect a target is to bind the Lock Autotarget to an easily accessible key on your keyboard . despite what the tooltip might suggest , tapping the assigned key will untarget anything you are currently targeting .
yes , you can do this . first , download mcedit . open up your classic . lvl and save it , in mcedit , as a schematic . then , make a super-flat world and open it ( or create a new one with mcedit ) , and paste the schematic where you need it to be . save it as a minecraft world . ( remember that you may need to patch things up ; i did this once and i had to seal things up because lava was coming in , and the floor could reach the void . )
diablo iii base game according to blizzard , the artisan cannot add sockets , and the game guide is erroneous ( to be updated in the future ) : artisans cannot add sockets to items . that information about the jeweler in the game guide of our website is erroneous and we are in the process of updating it . socketing was a feature that was in the game very early on , but ultimately it did not end up enhancing the play experience as we had hoped .
there are three trainers for light armor ( source ) : scouts-many-marshes | located : windhelm | adept ( 0 - 50 ) grelka | location : riften | expert ( 0 - 75 ) nazir | location : dark brotherhood sanctuary* | master ( 0 - 90 ) * nazir eventually moves to the dawnstar sanctuary if you are doing the dark brotherhood quest @layke outlines an effective way to use a trainer to level up without needing to worry about money , and also level up your pickpocketing skill at the same time . you just train , then pick pocket back your money , rinse and repeat . a method to level light armor without making use of a skill trainer is to find a weak enemy ( like a mud crab ) , and just let them attack you for awhile . if you use a healing spell to keep your health up , you should not run into any problems . using this method you will be able to level up your restoration skill as well .
some of the things you have to do for the riddles are pretty convoluted , so if you come across a specific riddle , it may be better just to ask about that one . solving pressure pad riddles : i only recently figured this out myself after around 30+ hours of play . what you need to do is step on the pads to activate them without touching the ground or anything else . there is nothing you can pick up to place on the pads , and using explosive gel or any other tool will not trigger them . often , the order does not explicitly matter , however , there is usually a manner which is most efficient or that you need to do in order to complete it , even though it is not stated in game ( like one where you have to glide back and forth between some buildings , rebounding off the sides ) . if you miss a pad , they will all reset and you have to start over . what you need to do to activate them without hitting the ground varies per riddle , but i have found that the line launcher and its upgrade , the line launcher tightrope are pretty helpful with these . solving the riddle with the questions marks on the ceiling : what you need to notice for this one is that you can not hit all 3 at once with your quickfire batarangs . the third one ( the one farthest from you ) will not be targeted . you need to hit that one with a remote control batarang either before or after you hit the first two with your quickfire . make sure you do this within the time limit ! ign has a video where they do this . the cut starts after they have already quickfire triggered the first two question marks .
healing weapons heal your teammates only , not your enemies . there is no way to deal damage with a healing weapon . if you try different parts in the weaponcrafting menu , the gun will show you the ' healing ' stat instead of damage ; you can use this to find the values you like ( i am not sure which one is the most efficient but i suspect it is beam ) . in terms of choosing different types of weapons , rockets will allow you have splash healing ( particularly if you use flak warheads ) which can be very useful in the blitz gamemode . rockets can also be used to heal yourself , but the efficiency of self-healing is significantly lower than when healing another player . beams will give you long range healing , and usually be more efficient as well , but require greater accuracy . rifle healing seems pretty popular as well , but i have never tried it . and pulse has the bounce shot effect , which can be an asset in enclosed spaces . rifle and pulse weapons can also be made into shotguns . choose the weapon type that suits your playstyle . experiment ! note that healing another player will also heal you , faster than self-healing with a rocket would . it is possible to overheal yourself just by healing other players
ok so rebooting windows did the trick . that being , i have no idea how or why it suddenly stopped to work , nor why rebooting windows fixed the issue .
i see no reason why you can not have a friend login in your old account and meet him somewhere where non-members have acesss to and trade the item there . as long as , of course , the item in question is not a members only item , then your non-member character can not do anything with it . this was of course like 10 years ago that i played runescape so a lot may have changed .
temple of the sun god is not a normal tower . it is a combo tower with a multitude of power and attack options . because of this you will not receive the same amount of cash while you have one . this goes for both this tower and all of the special abilities you can unlock throughout the game .
according to this page you can order one from nintendo for 11 eur + 3,50 eur shipping . they do not have an online shop though , you will have to contact them directly ( see contact information , konsumentenberatung : mail : info@nintendo . de ) and hope they will understand english .
it looks like i fixed it . the problem seems to have been the file Half-Life\valve\resource\GameMenu.res which got overwritten ( probably a bug ) in some way . reinstalling the default GameMenu.res fixed the problem .
children advance at age 10 , becoming either laborers or students . they will only become students if there is a school with space available . students then become laborers at ( around ) age 17 . age , however , is not all that easy to pinpoint . on average , citizens will age roughly ever 2.4 seasons , or 5 times per " year " ( which is 12 seasons ) . doing the math , on average , it is 2 years ( or 24 seasons ) per 10 " age " , and 3.4 years ( or 40.8 seasons ) to age 17 .
yes , night stalker benefits equally from this false night as he does from a normal night or from his own ultimate .
there is no puzzle in that room . you can tell from the icon it has on the map : all rooms with these round icon are dead-ends . the author refers to these rooms as " reward rooms " .
you are just simply using a tediore manufactured gun . in borderlands 2 , whenever you reload with a tediore , your character tosses the gun away , which explodes and can do damage to enemies . shortly thereafter , a new copy of the gun digistructs in your hands .
the system is mostly the same as it was in borderlands 1: beating playthrough one does nothing except unlock playthrough two ( "true vault hunter mode" ) , beating playthrough 2 scales enemies and rewards to your level , unlocking playthrough 3 ( if you are level 50 , i believe ) . playthrough 3 is new and scales to your level from the start . true vault hunter mode ( playthrough 2-2.5 ) playthrough 2 is unlocked simply by beating playthrough 1 , and is identical to playthrough 1 until completion except with higher level requirements , higher level enemies and generally harder enemies . once you beat playthrough two , enemies scale to within 3 levels of you ; some weak enemies ( like skag pups ) may be level 48 , most enemies will be level 49-51 , bosses will often be level 52 , and occasionally enemies will even be 53 . this is known as " playthrough 2.5" as it was in borderlands 1 . loot scales to within a couple levels ; most drops will be level 49 or 50 . quest rewards scale to your level too ; this is why it is important not to start certain side quests until playthrough 2.5 , otherwise you will miss out on the highest level rewards . side quests scale to when you start the mission so do not take them too early , if you want a level 50 reward , wait until you have finished the main quest . of course if the reward is green , you can go ahead and do it because the reward is junk anyway . note , without the uvhm dlc that it is still important to cap out your level , not just get to playthrough 2.5 before getting rewards , but as of right now the max level without the uvhm dlc is still 50 , and it is hard not to be level 50 by the time you complete the second playthrough . ultimate vault hunter mode ( playthrough 3 ) as of a patch april 2013 , there is also now an ultimate vault hunter mode or playthrough 3 , which is scaled to your level and much harder . it is mostly explained in these patch notes and this explanation : ultimate vault hunter mode is unlocked for a character once they have completed the main story missions in true vault hunter mode and reached level 50 . unlike other playthroughs , ultimate vault hunter mode can be replayed multiple times with players able to reset their overall mission progress at any time from the main menu . no more tutorial missions -- characters in ultimate vault hunter mode begin in southern shelf with the " cleaning up the berg " mission . while playing in ultimate vault hunter mode , enemies and bosses will scale according to the player 's current level or , if playing with others , the highest-level player in that party . -gameplay changes in uvhm : enemy health generally increased 4x . enemies now have a moderate amount of health regeneration . increased duration of slag damage multiplier effect . upped the damage that slagged enemies take from 2x to 3x . weapon swap speed increased to better facilitate slag use . enemies now more likely to drop ammo . loot midgets are now " legendary loot midgets " that can drop legendary and other top-tier gear . powerful new “ancient” e-tech relics and rare pearlscent-grade weapons can be picked up in ultimate vault hunter mode . generally speaking , enemies are harder , have much more health , slag is much more effective , rare drops are increased and certain new e-tech relics and pearlescent ( cyan colored ) equips are avalible only in uvhm . the e-tech relics and pearlescents are only availible in uvhm for people with the ultimate vault hunter upgrade pack ( $5 dlc , included for free with the season pass ) . note that due to the increased difficulty and increased efficacy of slag , uvhm is particularly suited to co-op play . just like in " raid " boss fights , a siren with res is always useful . to my knowledge there is no " playthrough 3.5" since the " . 5" was always about enemies/loot that scale to your level . playthrough 3 scales from the start so there is no extra post-playthrough for scaling .
full rush : just means what it means : the ai will build up forces as soon as possible without researching upgrades through the engineering bay , forge , or evolution chamber , trying to finish the game early . timing attack : the timing attack depends on the race you are up against . there are several timing attacks programmed into the ai : against protoss : blink-stalker , stalker robo , dark templar , four gate . against zerg : baneling bust , roach rush , ling roach , mutalisk . against terran : marine stim , marine siegetank , marauder helion , cloaked banshee . aggressive push : i believe ( need some input ) this mode will do a timing push as well but with everything the ai has with a focus on winning the game on the push ( "timing push " means for example getting an upgrade and attacking right as it finishes before the opponent has gotten his own upgrade that would allow him to defend it ) economic focus : this is the macro mode , building up economy and practising the long game . straight to air : speaks for itself . rushing an ai opponent that uses this build would be pretty much an automatic win . this mode is for practising air battles .
they are recalculating the dps ( damage per second ) based on the bonus . so they do 4 more " damage per shot " , which results in 2 more " damage per second " of sustained attacking .
peter molyneux has said that the only change you will notice is the things other people say to you . nothing major . a complete description of the relationship can be found on the lionhead forums . note this comment about how npc speech is affected : fable iii will read your save file of ii , npc 's will talk about your end game decisions
an easy way to kill him is to equip boots of introspection and the enchanted knight armor and to have the unicorn horn . and spam black demons
you could try to use a danger room to injure them . it consist of a spike trap triggered by a lever , where your . . . test subject will stand and be injured . the last time i did one , i used an actual wooden menacing pike instead of a training spear as the advice in the article , and i noticed that it tends to give your dwarf a nice wound after just a single lever pull .
your son and daughter are playing on a local area network . if your wifi is not password protected , someone could easily log on and edit your world .
there is still no definitive list , but there is a pretty comprehensive review here . according to this guy , pc has better textures and allows to zoom in closer , pc loads faster , when playing with a mouse you have minor conveniences like hovering on top of aliens-in-view icons to see hit percentages ( i am playing with a mouse and i have never knew it ) . important : multiplayer is not cross-platform , so you better follow your friends . reviewer explicitly states that he felt no tactical performance gain on any platform . tactical view grid should also be classified as a minor convenience - after some hours , you will be easily telling distances at a glance .
yes , the game is designed around being a single player game with the added option of multiplayer . that being said a coordinated team will do better due to being able to combine different classes together . this is from a video where jay wilson gives tips for inferno mode . update : first person to beat diablo on inferno did it solo , so it is definitely possible . source
talbot 's got a limited move set , and most of them involve quick-time events , for example : he takes a swing at you , which you dodge and counter talbot pins your arm behind your back , where you bite his arm to get out you and he cross arms , but he drops the knife into his other hand for a quick slash ( this appears to be the trickiest one - you have to go from mashing the circle button to hitting triangle and you have a very short window in which to do so ) he knocks you down , and you kick him in the head to break his hold screwing up more than one of these in a row on crushing seems to be a recipe for game over . there is a particular pattern to when he goes for the final kill ( and sully shows up to take a shot ) and i do not see much of a pattern about when this happens . it might just be a function of how much damage you do to him , as most of the videos i have seen where he goes down quickly , nathan 's always on the offensive , punching constantly when not involved in a qte . here 's a video of someone beating him on crushing in about 2 and a half minutes , although there is no commentary or other prompts so it is tough to glean much information from it :

no there is no way to change your patron god . source : i found the same question you asked on the official forum of the game and all replies to this question were negative . i would not worry about it thought because patron god bufffs do not really make much of a difference , while i do agree that 1% experience buff is almost un-noticable other god buffs are not really that great either . some of the better god buffs are those 5% additional mana/hp and if you do some calculations you will see that those 5% really make almost no difference
there is no version of civilization 5 for the xbox 360 . there is civilization : revolution , but it is a completely different game . even if there were , it is fairly rare that pc and xbox 360 players can play multiplayer together . i can think of perhaps a handful of games where this is the case . so the answer is no , you can not play civilization 5 between a pc and the xbox 360 .
they go in order of how many people have the ribbon . basically the ribbon that will show up when you have multiple ribbons should be the best/rarest one .
they are in there , the new ones have made me laugh ( especially the two-hander head banging ) . . . but they are random . getting them to show up is not a guaranteed thing . all i can suggest is keep playing . . i often work my combats to be 1 on 1 or 1 on 2 and such and i get the kill cam slo-mo quite often .
just hit the default punching bag in super training and you will be given random punching bags ( up to a max of 12 ; throw away extra bags at this point , or use them up ) . somewhat rarely you will be given an unmarked white bag called a reset bag which totally resets evs . i have heard rumors that pokemon with 0 evs are more likely to give out reset bags , but in my experience pokemon with full evs at the least still can give ev bags . the ev reset is complete and level does not matter . then you can just use super training to perfectly train your pokemon .
there are more than 10 different foods or drinks found in the game . here is a list : chicken on a stick curry chicken balls ( next to the undercover hq in north point , next to spicy squid in aberdeen ) dragon kick fish dumpling skewer herb tea ice cream noodle bowl pork bun roast duck spicy squid ( next to the massage parlor by fish market in aberdeen ) waffle eggs you can find most of these in the Night Market . there are plenty of food stands , drink vending machines , and tea shops all around hong kong . here is a video guide by predni showing you all different location of food and drinks :
this is an occasional bug that many people ( myself included ) have experienced . for reasons currently unknown , a skill will be debuffed down to its starting level for your character 's race . increasing your skill level ( whether through normal skill usage , training , reading a skill book , etc . ) generally seems to restore the skill to its proper value . if you are on the pc version , you can also fix it by opening the console and issuing the command player.modav skillname 1 followed by player.modav skillname -1 . note that the internal name of the archery skill is " marksman " , not " archery " .
one way is the one described in this answer : the trick is to force the other car to stop in a way it would take time for the npc to actually drive around you . just stop your car in front of the other will not usually work . force it in a corner . another way , which i found way easier , is to shoot the driver dead . do not aim the back of the car , aim the head of the driver ! there are multiple ways to do this : stops your car in front of his car and shoot at him approach his car from a side and shoot him shoot from behind aiming the windshield , you will eventually kill him
starcraft 2 does not support lan , so yes you had need two licenses , but you had be playing over battle .netnot lan .
yeah , same thing happened to me , but i would not think much of it , as it is in closed beta still and is not perfect yet . i have notified valve , and they will probably get on that soon , because closed beta is just that- people playing the game , detecting problems , and reporting then to the devs to fix . all in all , there is no fix that us users can implement , but valve is good about stuff like that , so keep up with their response . ( if any )
split the workers by sending 3 to one side and 3 to other side . it does not give much advantage , but pros like to do it .
this is what each power-up does :
minecraftaddict 's " extreme delay redstone timer " is the longest delay circuit i know of . ( but i can see from the comments that you have already found it ) . however , directly using this circuit will not work with a light sensor output , since the output of a light sensor would be 10 minutes on and 10 minutes off . the solution to this is to connect the output of your light sensor to a falling-edge and rising-edge monostable circuit that are or'd together . this is an image of a rising-edge trigger on the left , and a falling-edge trigger on the right . you would connect the a inputs together – to the output of your light trigger . when the a input is turned on , the q output of the left circuit pulses . when the a output turns off , the q output of the right circuit pulses . because of this , you can connect the two q output wires together ( oring them ) to have an output that sends a signal whenever the light-sensor changes . however , these circuits are designed to make a very short pulse . because minecraftaddict 's delay circuit comes with a built-in pulse shortener , you will want to send a slightly longer signal to it . to do this , just add more repeaters to the edge triggers ( add an extra repeater to when the current repeaters are ) . leave the repeaters that should be on the first setting like that , but change the repeaters that should be on the second setting ( according to the image ) to the fourth setting .
in order to purchase an " enemy " character ( bad guys if you are good , good guys if you are bad ) , you must first beat them senseless . attack the character long enough and , instead of breaking , they will become available for purchase with b just like a co-aligned character . once you have one " evil " character , it is probably easier to switch to them before purchasing other bad guys , to avoid the fight .
support relationships are the bread and butter of fire emblem games . when units are within 2 squares of a another unit they have a support rating with , they will gain stats in fights . sort of like what you get for units beside each other , or using pair up . but where the side-by-side boosts increase secondary stats , like to-hit , dodge , or crit chance , supports increase primary stats , like strength , magic , defense , and the like . the exact stat boost is dependent on the two units , and is also affected by their current level of relationship . the higher the support rating , the better the stats . if the support relationship is between a male character ( such as virion ) and a female character ( like sully ) , you will see that they can hit up to the s class support rating . if they hit that , they automatically get married . there is no veto or " are you sure ? " type of screen . you hit that conversation , they are married . done deal . so be careful when you are looking at that last support conversation , as it may have consequences you are not planning on . in previous games , each character could only have up to three supports . in awakening , the number of supports you can have seems to be unlimited . there is no reason not to fulfill every single support conversation you can , except for the caveat mentioned above .
from the game manual : " the mission selection screen also shows you three boxes that indicate if you were previously successful in battle on medium , hard or expert difficulty . there is no ‘easy’ option . if you wanted easy , you should not have signed up for the space navy and you are not fit to take command of a fleet of andromedan space mites . " the difficulty can be raised for each battle at the deployment screen . harder battles bring more honour . as for the third mission , design your own ships . anomalies here lower everyone 's shields and prevent deployment of fighters , so you might concentrate on armor instead . dedicated anti-missile frigates might be worth considering . remember to set orders to your ships . clear their frigates first as they are easy to bring down . concentrate your fleet to one corner of the map , use a decoy ship in the opposite corner to divide the enemy force .
as you noticed , destruction is pretty straightforward . each cast and while continued casting , you will increase skill , but this has a caveat : only if you are attacking someone . if you are fizzling your spell in the middle of town , it is not going to increase it . alchemy is also straightforward : each potion created will increase your skill . as dpatchery notes , eating ingredients for effect determination will also increase your skill by a small amount . with enchanting , each enchant ( or disenchant , as lesspop_morefizz notes ) as will increase skill . dpatchery also notes that you can increase your skill by recharging items with soul gems . restoration , namely the healing spells , only increase skill if your health is below its maximum . the others only work if you are in combat or near hostile enemies : this includes spells like steadfast ward . for summoning spells ( essentially most things in the conjuration school ) , you will not get a skill up for the summon until you enter the range of hostile mobs and , in the case of summoned creatures ( like the atronach and the familiar ) , they do some damage . with bound weapons , entering range of hostile mobs is all that is necessary to gain conjuration skill ; however , using them in combat will increase their appropriate weapon skill , not conjuration . alteration and illusion spells that are targeted towards messing with hostile mobs need hostile mobs within range to skill up . buffs , like oakflesh , do not increase skill without hostility as well . others , like candlelight and muffle , are recastable without hostility but only increase skill by a small amount .
maximum soft capacity for magic find in 2.0.1 . remains at 300% . . . soft capacity is the maximum % of magic find that player can accumulate with items on him and follower , it does not include buffs and bonuses . hard capacity is calculated maximum possible magic find . which was at 680% prior to the 2.0.1 . since then paragon levels do not reward magic find anymore , nephalem valor is removed from the game and monster power level doesn’t increase magic find ( it does give you better legendary items but it is not calculated in magic find ) we are left with : +10% per player from strength in numbers buff ( max +30% with full party ) . +25% shrine of fortune . making hard cap for mf 355% this ~50% mf reduction would seem drastic , but i does not really matter that much anymore since mf in 2.0.1 . is almost useless because your magic find now affects : 100% for blue items , 30% for rares and only 10% for legendary/set items for more info on gear slots and items you should check wikwocket ’s answer which stays pretty much valid except for nephalem valor . writing more detailed and updated list of best possible items for magic find really doesn’t matter anymore , even if you managed somehow to get more than 300% mf from items it wouldn’t count , and i really doubt someone would sacrifice all the stats for mere max 35% mf on legendary/set items . source , source

it seems indeed that there is a bug related to thieves guild leadership : if the player completes the main story arc before doing the side and improvement quests for vex and delvin , brynjolf may not interact with the player and instead repeat that he is busy and that he will talk to you later . consequently , becoming the guildmaster will be rendered impossible . this may be a part of a bug where karliah disappears and does not appear in either the nightingale hall or the twilight sepulcher . she does , however , return to the snow veil sanctum where you first encounter her . possible fix : run outside when finishing your first interaction with brynjolf . you need to run outside as quick as possible by going to the ladder and exiting . you should see the quest update pop up reading : " started under new management " . afterward , go back inside and proceed to brynjolf . to talk to brynjolf , let him go to the middle of the cistern first , and wait . he then should start talking to you , finishing the quest . if this does not resolve the issue , it may be worth it to try attacking them , paying the reparations , and trying again . another possible fix is to get the quest about fixing debt from the guy at the riften stables . the player will be told to talk to sapphire . instead , sapphire should be sitting on the bridge just inside riften and when approached will say " i do not have any business with you . " or " we will talk after the ceremony . " attack her 3 times , and this should cause her to start attacking the player notifying them that " under new management " has been completed and that the player should talk to brynjolf . upon entering the ragged flagon , the player will be required to pay 1000 gold to vex as reparations for killing a fellow thieves guild member . after doing so , speak with brynjolf and the questline should be completed . as a last resort , you can use the console to fix this issue : setstage tgleadership 0
sadly my friend as of this posting ( and current dlc availability ) there are no bards you can marry , male or female . since you stated you can not use console commands i need not include a listing of those . . . but here is a list of who you can marry . hope this is a consolation to your lamentations for a bard so fair , well you get the picture , lol . . . this is your link to marital bliss : http://www.realsg.com/2011/11/guide-skyrim-marriage-how-to-and-list.html it describes how to marry , who you can marry , conditions needed and locations . hope this helped
in the unmodded game , you can still rejoin a different faction or support a claimant in order to end your current faction . however , there is not a way to return to being unaffiliated . you probably just need to make peace and raise your standing with one faction until they offer you the chance to become a mercenary again .
no . lock range never increases . the best you can do is use the thief ring so that you can get closer to enemies before they spot you .

it does not seem to matter how fast you beat on them to determine the quality of the overall drops . the most important thing is to actually kill them before they open a portal and escape . the last drops upon death ( and possibly right before death ) are magic items , as opposed to gold , so it is well worth making certain you kill them . there are different types of treasure goblins , and they seem to have different qualities of loot . i encountered a treasure pygmy during act 3 of normal , and , despite not killing him particularly quickly ( certainly not as fast as i had killed some early treasure goblins ) , i had the extreme fortune of having 3 rare items drop from him . i am not certain if this is simply an extremely lucky coincidence , or if the quality of the drops was influenced by the particular monster title . edit : i just encountered a treasure goblin much later in act 3 , and he dropped 4 regular magic items ( no rares ) , even though i beat him down much faster than the treasure pygmy . this seems to corroborate the idea that the treasure pygmy may simply be a rarer , better version of the treasure goblin . edit : after quite a few more tests , ranging from chasing the treasure goblin ( of a number of varieties ) around , to beating them down before they could move more than a few yards , to killing them moments before they step through a portal , there is absolutely no discernible difference in the quantity or quality of items they drop . they always drop 1-4 magic items , plus gold , gems , and crafting pages/tomes ( if you are high enough level for gems and/or crafting pages/tomes to drop ) .
as of 2.0.1 . ( maybe even few patches earlier ) there is no more retrain button , you can now freely choose skills for your follower . meaning , if you do not like the chosen skill , you can simply click on the other one to activate it . changing skills has no cooldown and can be done anytime , even in combat . but it will not reset the actual cooldown on skill to prevent abuse .
destroying ships yields only half of their cargo . so , it is generally better to board them . if a ship has gold , sinking it will still give you all the gold . and , as you suspect , later on you will be able to capture ships and send them on missions to earn credits .
each hour in minecraft is equal to 1000 minecraft " ticks " . the clock in minecraft for a day starts at 6 am at 0 ticks and ends at 5:59 am on 23999 ticks . that said , dawn is at 7 am while dusk is at 7 pm . so why does the clock start at 6 am , and why is dawn 1 hour later and not at the start ? i am not entirely sure , but from personal experience i get up to start getting ready for work at 6 , the sun is at times starting to rise at 7 am ( seasons and the equinoxes need to be factored in ) . i am not sure if it is like that with the rest of the world or sweden ( i’m quite sure mojang is based there ) but we can assume that a 12-hour cycle is used so people do not complain about having more night than day when building on the surface . you can read up more on minecraft 's day-night cycle here .
according to this wiki and this wiki : dye trader will move in when : any material used to make dye is in the player 's inventory , such as the yellow marigold . party girl will move in when : you have at least 8 npcs ( note : there is a 2% chance for the party girl to spawn each morning , so it can take a while for her to arrive . ) steampunker will move in when : the player has killed any hard mode boss and there is a suitable house for her . painter will move in when : the player has obtained at least 4 npcs . witch doctor will move in when : the player kills the queen bee . pirate will move in when : the player fights the pirates by using a treasure map obtained by killing hard-mode sea monsters . cyborg will move in when : the player kills plantera . truffle will move in when : the player has a house with mushroom furniture ( mushroom workbench/mushroom doors/mushroom chair ) in a surface mushroom biome . note : just like with any npc , the player must have an empty and valid house available .
no , the stopwatch does not work on bosses . from the strategywiki : do not bother trying to use this against bosses another source is this guide on gamefaqs : the real downside to it is that it does not stop time while facing bosses , nor does it stop time in the battle arena . so the conclusion is that there are 2 events where it does not work on enemies : bosses battle arena
the upper echelon of the companions ( fighter 's guild ) , called the circle , is composed of werewolves . as you advance through the companions quest line , you will eventually be inducted into the circle , whereupon they will perform a ritual to turn you into a werewolf . ( you need to become a werewolf to continue the companions questline , but you are not forced to complete the quest ( and become a werewolf ) if you do not want to ) .
the hyperion vanguard is one of my favorite m6 ( the other being the springblossom ) . not only does it have a huge cargo bay ( biggest for m6 ) , it is the only m6 that has a docking bay and can fit a ton of different types of weapons on board . here are my typical loadouts for the hype : front guns ( 8 ) : 6x concussion impulse generators 2x plasma burst generators front turrets ( 2x2 ) : 2x energy bolt chainguns 2x energy bolt chainguns back turrets ( 2x3 ) : 3x particle accelerator cannons 3x particle accelerator cannons missiles : wraiths wasps mosquito missiles ( for mosquito missile defense system ) reasoning : cigs are your all purpose guns , but having 8 is overkill since your energy banks can not keep up . even 6 will drain all your energy at some point , but its good against everything m3 and up . you can never have enough melty goodness . pbgs are the best anti fighter weapon in existance . even 2 is enough to melt the face off of every m4-m5 you come across . best yet , you do not have to be terribly accurate against those fast and agile fighters since the pbg has a huge aoe . also , pbgs has the best energy/damage ratio in the game , they are even pretty good against capital ships . i put ebcs in my front turrets for the added firepower without draining my energy for cigs . the ebcs alone are usually enough to kill most m3s in a few salvos , and your huge cargo capacity means you can hoard lots of ammo without trouble . the only options you have for the back are pacs , ires , and fbls . fbls , as you noticed , suck terribly , so i put pacs back there for a decent punch against chasing targets . they are also pretty decently ranged to pick off missiles . sometimes , i go with 4x cig and 4x pbgs up front , which is still a killer combo . as for missiles , the wraith missile is your primary anti capital ship weapon . yes cigs can do the job given enough time , but wraiths are just so good at it ( 8x125k damage ) . the only down side is they are hard to get since its a terran weapon , so hoard whatever you can pick up during those big terranxargon battles . firestorm torpedos , tornado missiles , and typhoon missiles can also be used as a backup if you do not have enough wraiths against capital ships . the hornet missile deserves an honorable mention as its the best way to 1 shot a khaak cluster at range before it separates , they are also great for asteroid destruction . wasp missiles are my favorite anti fighter missile , they are also good distractions so the enemy ship will not be able to target down your firestorm torpedo . usually i fire the torpedo then spam a bunch of wasps and things typically blow up nicely after that .
you can turn on the " resource icon " overlay which will put up floating icons showing what all the resources are ( ctrl + r , or click on the " toggle map options " button to the left of the mini-map and tick " resource icons" ) . if you then zoom out you should be able to see where the resources are quite easily , and what they are .
most important rule : when a chunk is unloaded , so are the mobs ( and all other items ) on it , although passive mobs will not be removed . there is also a limit on the number of mobs that can be loaded at one time : 200 hostile and 15 neutral mobs ( i do not know if there is a limit on passive mobs ) . also , hostile mobs are removed if they leave the 9x9 chunks that they are allowed to spawn in . running away will usually allow you to stay out of the reach of hostile mobs , since a chunk needs to be loaded a certain amount of time before mobs will start to spawn , but the chunks immediately behind you could have the max allowable mobs , making it dangerous at best to turn around . take a look at the wiki for more information .
there are some mods that can do that , for example http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/631622-endermen-dont-pick-up-blocks-mod/ . i remember there was somewhere mod for creepers too .
here is a video describing how to get the staff of wisdom . you start at dragon shrine after the first enemy there is a pharros lockstone port . unlock it to reveal a hidden wall which has the chest containing the staff of wisdom .
it looks like you have dug down-stairs on the level below . down-stairs need an up-stair below them to work - or an up/down-stair if you want to go down additional levels . if you do not want to dig around , you can solve your problem in this case by building an up/down-stair on one of the tiles on the lower level ( through the constructions menu ) . make sure you use material that your dwarves can get to for the construction job , though ( so not one of the nearby gabbro stones ) .
there are two " new " units for terran . i use the term new loosely because one is simply a transformed version of an existing unit . terran widowmine the widowmine is a very powerful unit and can be used both offensively and defensively . as a defensive unit , it is wonderful for warding off drops . one or two can effectively protect your mineral line for other terran drop harassment . you will want to place the mine that enemy forces will be coming into . if you have ever used vulture mines in starcraft 1 , it is the same mentality for defense . as an offensive unit , the power that the mine possesses is very good against any unit as it is essentially un-blockable damage . the damage it does is spell damage , so much like a psi-storm , it does full damage on contact . again , it is all about placement . the mine itself does not have a lot of health . you want the mines to be in place before your attacks/defense needs to occur . the top of ramps , 1/2 a screen behind the battle area so that when you " retreat " the enemy gets drawn into it , even in lower leagues , you may be able to sneak a drop in and activate a mine on your opponents mineral line fully decimating their harvester count . these are all good places to use the mine . hellbat the biggest benefit to using the hellbat is that in its hellbat form it is considered a biological unit . what does that mean ? it means that they can be healed by medivacs ! hellbats also gain a 50% health buff in this form , but are a slower moving unit and lose their long splash damage in favour of a cone effect in front of them . i am only going to address how to use the hellbat as that is how the question is formed . yes there are methods that you can say use the hellion to harass and for map control and then use the hellbat later on for other purposes . how to use them really depends on your game play style . however , the general consensus is that they are used for tanking damage while other units deal damage to the opposing forces . depending on if you are going bio or mech the hellbats are in front while the marines/marauders/tanks are behind them dealing damage to the opposing forces . protoss mothership core this early air unit allows protoss players versatile playstyles early on in the game while providing excellent defense for your home base and the ability to detect cloaked units ( casted spell ) . the photon overcharge ability allows your nexus to become a defensive attacking structure with excellent range ( 20 damage and 13 range ) . this is useful for protecting your base from early attacks and protecting your probes . it also has the mass recall ability of the original mothership in wings of liberty . as such , this can be use for both offensive and defensive capabilities . your army is far away and you are getting attacked at home ? 2 seconds later and your army is home ( assuming your mothership core did not get killed ) . it also upgrades into a heart of the swarm version of the mothership , which compared to the wings of liberty version , has time warp instead of vortex . tempest the tempest is a long ranged siege ship , mostly in an offensive capability . it has a massive attack range and does heavy damage against massive air units ( carriers , battle cruisers , brood lords , etc . ) . again this is a slow unit . the usage behind this would be much like using brood lords or siege tanks ( or guardians from brood war if you want to go back farther ) . they have a slow fire rate as well so you want to ensure they are protected while they rain down damage from the skies . the biggest benefit of this unit is that it can hit both air and ground . because of its massive range the unit can attack farther than it can see . you will need other units leading the way to ensure this unit has maximum benefit . oracle this is a very fast , offensive unit that is frequently used to grant high ground vision and hit and run tactics . it also has a support ability to slow units to a crawl so the ground forces can catch up . the time warp ability is a casted area of effect that slows all units caught within it . it reduces movement by 50% . excellent for chasing down units trying to escape . a few sentries combined with this effect allows chargelots to close in , and decimate an army . attack speed is not reported to have been slowed by this spell , only movement at this point . the unit itself does not have a direct attack , but you can use its pulsar beam when it has energy to do so . when it is activated , it does fast , high amounts of damage to light units . this makes them ideal for charging into harvester lines and decimating the income of your opponent ( un-upgraded 2 shots will kill any harvester ) . with enough energy , you can send in a few of these units , time warp the harvester line and activate the pulsar beams to destroy their economy while you race ahead . they also have a reveal ability that shows an area on a map but with no detection . zerg viper this is the new defiler if you ever played starcraft:brood war . it is a support unit and has no direct attacking abilities . blinding cloud completely negates the range attack of all units forcing them to become melee fighters . this ability used against any army can be devestating if there is no melee backup . a cloud on a group of marines and marauders makes them useless against a zergling army . it provides time for those lings or ultralisks to cover the ground between the units without taking any damage . well placed clouds can cripple the power of an attacking army while your melee units do damage ( roaches melee when close enough ) . they also have an ability called abduct which does pretty much what the name says . it allows you to pull a unit from where it is to where the viper is . the cast range is very long ( 9 , same as extended thermal lance of a colossus ) so you can pull fortified units to an exposed position where they can be destroyed . think of " charging " into some marines with tanks behind them with your army only to have them retreat and hide behind the tank fire . with vipers you can pull those tanks forward as you are charging and those tanks then become the first things targeted as the marines end up running behind the tanks because they were pulled forward . all these abilities take energy , which can be replenished from zerg structures at the cost of 200 hp for 50 energy which takes 20 seconds to convert in full . swarm host think of these like a burrowed siege tank that spawns ranged broodlings ( called locusts ) . they are an offensive unit that can be hidden behind mineral lines , or used to provide a first wave to absorb siege tank fire before your main army charges in . the usage of them is no different than spawning infested terrans from an infestor except there is no energy cost , only time . enemies require detection in order to attack the hosts when they are burrowed and spawning locusts so you could get them into the front lines early , spawn locusts , and just keep them there . while this is not very safe it can keep your enemy at bay for a while . i believe these can be used similar to widowmines in both the offensive and defensive manner described previously .
i think it is the same issue as this known bug and apparently steam support is investigating . so until then it seems like we are playing with bots or community servers
frost only becomes your horse if you persuade louis letrush to let you keep him or kill after you talk to him after you have stolen frost from the black-briar manor . if you just ride off without completing the quest frost will just return to where you first stole him ( black-briar manor ) . if you own him and you were to mount another horse ( at least another horse you own ) he will remain at the location you left him so far as i can tell . i use shadowmere ( who seems to do the same thing ) and i just parked frost at a stable so at least he would be safe . he has stayed there since . also any horse you bought from a stable will return to that stable when you begin using another horse . when i first got shadowmere the horse i purchased from whiterun began to walk away and when i next went back to the whiterun stables he was there safe and sound .
note : this is a workaround , not an official way to do it . i have noticed that on modded minecraft versions , the launcher just basically shrugs and skips the library checks . here 's how to make a version a " modded " version without it actually being modded . first , browse to your . minecraft/versions directory . if you are using windows , it is under %APPDATA%\roaming\.minecraft . you can get to it by opening run and then typing in %APPDATA%\roaming\.minecraft and then pressing enter . if you are using ios , i think it is under Library/Application Data/minecraft . if you are using a unix-based operating system , it is under ~/.minecraft/ . copy the folder of the version you want to skip libraries on to the current directory . it should come out as something like "1.7.10 ( copy ) " . rename it to ( say ) "1.7.10a " . go in the folder . you should see a jar file and a json file . rename the jar file to what you renamed the folder to , exactly , but with its original extension . same with the json file . open the json file . you should see " id": " something " . rename the something inside the original quotation marks with what you renamed the folder to . minecraft should not check the libraries , as it does not recognize the id of the version as one of its remote versions . or so i think . i believe this works because of some lines i saw in my minecraft logs : [11:54:21 INFO]: Finished downloading /home/noel/.minecraft/libraries/tv/twitch/twitch/5.16/twitch-5.16.jar for job ' version and libraries': local file matches local checksum , using that i think that minecraft just uses the local files if they match their local checksum . that and the id thing mentioned in step 5 .
no . neither sunset sarsaparilla nor nuka-cola count towards this achievement .
as per the alpha 11 release notes , this is now possible : prisoners now count down their remaining sentence whilst in your jail . once they have served their full jail term they are automatically released . they will walk to the exit and be allowed to leave by your guards . their nameplate will flash " released " note : we count down sentences at an accelerated rate - otherwise nobody would ever be released note : we do not yet support early release due to parole therefore , prisoners will now be released once they have served their time - and they will even serve their time a little faster right now . this is due to the lack of a management feature to reduce sentences ( as in : parole , or other ways of releasing them early ) .
no . you can only reroll existing affixes into new affixes of the same category* ( vit-> armor ) . i.e. you cannot roll a secondary affix into a primary affix . there are some limitations for this rerolling : you cannot add a second affix that is existing on the item . so no doubling up of int affixes , for example . you cannot add a resist all or ( specific resist ) affix onto an item if the other exists already . this is to prevent doubling up of resists ( owe nerf for monks basically ) you can only add affixes that can be found naturally on the equipment slot . weapons will never roll +armor , for instance , and bracers will never have a socket . you cannot reroll specific legendary mods ( the only one i know of so far is the increased fire damage taken on andariel 's helm ) . you also can not reroll the orange stats , but that should be obvious .
the bioware blog recently posted about this information , which i will summarize here . mechanics earning reputation in mass effect 3 is a bit different from the first two games . rather than earning only paragon and renegade points , you can also earn neutral reputation , so there are 3 types of rep in me3 . this means you can now mix being paragon/renegade without worrying about getting locked out of the more difficult charm/intimidate options . when you earn paragon/renegade rep , it'll show up as blue/red , whereas if you earn neutral rep , it'll increase your reputation bar 's size as a whole while retaining the same blue/red ratio . click through for the larger version . your total reputation ( blue/red/neutral ) will determine whether or not you will be able to pass a charm/intimidate block . the lines on the bar are " checkpoints " which serve as gates for more difficult dialogue options . i marked them with the thin lines of red , in case it was difficult to see ( this is not my shep , this is the photo from the blog post ) . as per usual , you get rep from completing missions and making dialogue choices . for missions with no paragon/renegade choice but still have a large impact , you will get neutral rep . story impact in contrast to older bioware games , you can never actually be the villain in me3 , though this should be rather clear from how they handled the first 2 games . no matter what , you will be fighting to save the galaxy . the manner in which you do it will be what differentiates a paragon from a renegade . also , bullying people into giving you more money or discounts will not be the crux of what makes a renegade decision in this game . who needs credits if there is nowhere to spend them because civilized life has been destroyed ? reputation gain will be based on when you have to make a decision in the game . here are a few examples of what kind of rep you would get , taken from the blog : confronted on the citadel by a desperate refugee with a gun , you give her some credits and help her find a place to sleep . ( paragon ) as a human colony falls to reaper forces , you order down an orbital strike , brutally killing thousands of colonists to prevent the reapers from turning them into husks . ( renegade ) you land at a turian fuel depot taken by reaper forces and clear it out , enabling allied forces to keep fighting . ( general reputation ) tl ; dr bioware has finally made a single-player game that lets you make morally grey choices without nerfing yourself , gameplay-wise . rejoice !
there are 2 normal slaughter arenas in the game ( bandits and hyperion robots ) and 2 dlc arenas ( wildlife , and fantasy ) . the first one , the bandit slaughter arena , is accessed from the fridge ( which you will be heading to very soon ) , just inside on the left . the hyperion slaughter arena is in the ore chasm , which is reached from the eridium blight ( one of the last areas you will go to ) . if you have the dlc for the creature slaughter dome , that is in the natural selection annex which is accessed from the wildlife exploitation preserve . there is also a fantasy-themed slaughter dome in the fourth campaign dlc , tiny tina 's assault of dragon keep , in the murderlin 's temple area .
most dungeons are cleared when you have killed all important inhabitants , and as a result of doing that , you have seen the whole dungeon . the game does not force you to loot stuff ( e . g . , werewolf form can not loot ) so it comes down to just killing ; you do not have to do your quest . a victorious sound will play once you clear the dungeon , and the ambient sound will stop . if you do not kill all important inhabitants , inhabitants might respawn and the dungeon will not be seen as cleared . another occasion where inhabitants respawn in a dungeon is when you start a new quest that involves that dungeon ; however , it will not change the cleared state of a dungeon . there are reports that some dungeons do not get cleared , or are cleared a different way . some report that whatever they try to do , the dungeon does not get cleared ; this might be because they still have a quest to do in the dungeon . other report that a dungeon gets cleared after looting a chest or learning a new dragon shout word . please note that not every dungeon has a word wall .
i do not have a reference , but from personal experience i think you are nearly right . if the disk is too badly damaged then you will not be able to install it at all . however , it appears to be that the installation process is slightly more tolerant of damage than playing directly , so you could get a disc that is too damaged to play but will still install . this could be for a number of reasons including that it does more error checks and retries when installing than playing for example . from personal experience there have been a couple of games that occasionally failed to load/play direct from disc . in these cases we have installed the games to the hard drive and successfully played them from there . so your test will not verify that the disc is not damaged , but will verify that it is playable .
the following was compiled by merging the 15 balance updates from this post http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/7979378171 and filling in the gaps from liquipedia . for future readers , note that this represents the changes to exiting units from the final patch in wings of liberty to the initial release of heart of the swarm . also , i have not played every unit , so please leave a comment if i should correct something and i will edit the post . glhf ! edit - march 19 , 2013: noted that pylon psionic matrix no longer covers higher ground . thanks to @chobok for pointing this out . more details here : http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=278806 terran reaper damage ( p-45 gauss pistol ) - decreased from 4 + 5 vs . light to 4 . range ( p-45 gauss pistol ) - increased from 4.5 to 5 . d-8 charges ( anti-building grenades ) - removed from the game . health - increased from 50 to 60 . speed - increased from 2.95 to 3.75 . nitro packs - removed from the game . train reaper - no longer requires a tech lab add-on . new ability : combat drugs - heals 2 health every second if the reaper is not attacked for 10 seconds . hellion new ability : battle mode - transforms the hellion into its hellbat form ( requires upgrade from tech lab after armory ) . siege tank siege mode - no longer requires upgrade . medivac new ability : ignite afterburners - speed boost that increases movement speed and acceleration to 4.25 for 8 seconds . 20 second cooldown . thor 250mm strike cannons - removed from the game . the thor can now switch between two modes : high-impact payload and explosive payload . the mode shift takes 4 seconds . when in high-impact payload mode , the thor switches to a different anti-air gun ( 250mm punisher cannons ) that has 10 range and deals 24 flat damage . thor radius , inner radius , and separation radius increased from 0.8215 to 1 . battlecruiser yamato cannon energy cost decreased from 125 to 100 . raven redesigned ability : seeker missile - can now fire from 10 range . missile comes out and stays immobile in front of the raven for 5 seconds while charging up , then rapidly moves ( it’s not dodgeable at this point ) and explodes at the target for 100 damage + splash . targeted unit lights up red when targeted . if the unit moves 13 range out of where the seeker missile is , the missile fizzles . energy cost decreased from 125 to 75 . armory the armory now only has one armor upgrade for both air and ground units . vehicle and ship weapon upgrades are still separate . protoss sentry hallucination - no longer requires research . stalker blink - research time increased from 140 to 170 seconds . phoenix range - increased from 4 to 5 ( anion pulse-crystals upgrade still grants +2 range ) . void ray prismatic beam - no longer charges up . cooldown decreased from 0.6 to 0.5 . no longer does passive +massive damage . supply - increased from 3 to 4 . new ability : prismatic alignment - increases damage to armored units by 6 for 20 seconds , with a 1 minute cooldown . this does not scale with upgrades . activating the prismatic alignment ability now causes a timer to display over the void ray for the duration of the effect . carrier interceptors can now change targets when they are in leash range . mothership vortex - removed from the game . new ability : time warp - creates a temporal field that slows all ground units’ movement speed by 50% . redesigned ability : mass recall - now a simple cast-and-click ability on a player’s nexus . once cast , the mothership and every friendly unit within a 7-range radius will be recalled to the nexus . pylon psionic matrix no longer covers ground higher than the pylon . this also means you cannot warp-in or cannon rush onto higher ground . dark shrine cost - changed to 150 / 150 , from 100 / 250 . zerg hydralisk new upgrade : muscular augments - hydralisks move 25% faster off creep ( requires lair ) . mutalisk speed - increased from 3.75 to 4 . new upgrade : tissue regeneration - health regeneration rate increased from . 2734 to 1 health / sec . infestor fungal growth - damage decreased from 30 + 10 vs . armored to 30 . is now a projectile . speed of the projectile is 12 . range increased to 10 . infested terrans no longer gain weapon and armor upgrades . infested terran egg health reduced to 70 . ultralisk damage - changed from 15 + 20 armored to 35 flat damage . spine crawler this unit now completely blocks pathing when placed next to other structures , including other spine crawlers . zerglings and other small units can no longer squeeze in between spine crawlers . the scale of this unit has been increased from 0.85 to 0.95 . spore crawler damage - increased from 15 to 15 + 15 vs . biological . no longer requires an evolution chamber . overlord / overseer pneumatized carapace - no longer requires lair . hatchery burrow - no longer requires lair . creep tumor no longer spawn instantly , but instead have a three second spawning animation . may now be placed on ramps .
it has an effect during diplomacy with the ai . the ai will be more friendly and less likely to attack you if you are using its favorite government , and will be less friendly and more likely to be hostile if you use the shunned government . i do not remember if civ 3 had this , but in some civs the ai would also sometimes request that you change to its favorite government . it does not have any effect on what the government bonuses are or anything like that . it is purely a diplomacy thing .
yes you can , " from a bygone era " will work , but it is completly messed quest . i completed it by pure coincidence . here are some links that might help with quest . http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/thewitcher2/show_msgs.php?topic_id=m-1-59197966pid=975399 http://www.gog.com/en/forum/the_witcher_2/quest_from_a_bygone_era
traffic is something my friends and i have spent a bit of time on as it is the major choke point in every city . the following is gathered information in a list of bullet points as there just is no other way to do this without rambling : traffic ai - is very stupid . . . it is a first-come , first-serve mentality with very little variance . now the ai will often take roundabout routes , but these are rarely helpful and you will often see that a vehicle will drive around in a circle three times before making the right hand turn it wanted to take . so focus on the first-come , first-serve when designing your city and laying down where you want things to flow to . avenues vs streets - streets and avenues are not interchangeable . you will really never want to use avenues exclusively because they have a meridian . they are meant to handle large traffic routes with as few intersections in them as possible . of note , it is better to place commercial down avenues as they generally get foot traffic , not vehicle traffic . streets are much better for everything else and can still be made into high-density . they will allow people to drive to their destination and turn in . this is the major difference and the reason as to why avenues are evil as a street replacement . if a person wants to get to the second building on the left hand side of the avenue they will have to drive all the way down the right side , do a u-turn and come back up in order to turn into their destination . this is a lot of traffic for no good reason . mass transit - the only things that will help traffic in your town are buses and streetcars . ferries will actually depend heavily on these systems as they only transport people , not vehicles . the key to buses is to not put the bus stops at intersections . this has the potential to hold up the traffic at those intersections while people are loading/unloading and can also then clog an intersection with pedestrians recently unloaded . put them in the middle of roads and keep the green overlay fairly nice . you will want the coverage for this to be anywhere sims will go ( buildings , pretty much ) . do not worry about covering a street if it only houses a single building ( and also put the sign on the side next to the building so the sims do not have to walk : ) ) . the same goes for your education as far as up to high school goes ( college and university take the normal public transit systems ) . keep the coverage to the residential areas only and avoid intersections . my knowledge on street cars is a bit lower , but i would keep the same notions as the buses . avoid the corners as this can cause sim overflow in cross walks . outside connections - i am not sure if roads outside are needed in the long run ( when you can import/export people/goods via ferry , rail and air port ) , but this is speculation at this point in time . what makes me hesitant is that you require a road connection to build a city hall . . . one is not required to keep it though . i will try and update this when i have more information . intersections - this is something that is actually very well done in your layout . for the most part , you are avoiding four way intersections and instead are using quite a few t-intersections . this works out awesomely for traffic as straight-through traffic seems to just ' stop ' for some reason at times . no one that i have seen yet has really figured out why ; everyone has just started avoiding them . of special note is when you have an avenue that you want a turn around on without slowing down traffic . dirt roads will put in stop signs only for the dirt road , allowing traffic to flow down the street/avenue unimpeded . this can give you a ' lossless ' intersection for use in special cases . however , keep an eye on this as sometimes the one little piece of dirt road you place can capture a vehicle in a vicious loop . multiple ways to the same location - this is more of just a design consideration , but it will help . now i started with saying the ai is dumb and aim at a first-come , first-serve mentality . this is the bit of a drawback to that one , but please keep the other statement in mind first . having multiple ways in and out of an area is a good thing . they do not have to be next to each other and can service from flow that would come from a completely different direction when made available . this will help remove choke points where all traffic eventually has to get to this intersection in order to get to that section of the city . now , addressing this to the screenshots of your city in particular . you have a lot of avenues , and i feel that that is going to be the main thing to take care of . unfortunately , removing an avenue means removing all the buildings along it . this is one of my pet peeves in the game . however , take a peek at the lower image in the bottom right corner . you have a little half moon peel off there ( and it is not showing bad traffic , i am just using it as an example ! ) . if the ai randomly decides to come up to that intersection and turn down that little path , it will have to go all the way around the loop to get out again before it can make its decision of where to go . this will probably favor traffic flow in one direction , either people leaving to work/shop/learn or the people returning from working/shopping/learning making the other half get really frustrated on the way back or not make it back at all ( sims are not unique , they are spammed and not guaranteed to make it ' home ' again so to speak . secondly , it does seem that you have some stops at intersections for your mass transit . you can try pushing them away from them . do not think logically about this of what you would see in the world around you . focus on avoiding corners and keeping the highlight of the coverage area over the area you are covering . the information about this game is constantly changing and is being updated currently .
generally in most dungeons when you clear it ( kill the boss , loot the final chest , get a word of power , etc . ) there is a path you can keep exploring . the path can sometimes be activated by a switch or lever and opens up a new route . this new route can either take you near the entrance of the dungeon or takes you outside . this eliminates the need to walk all the way back to the entrance the way you came .
as far as i understand it , your field upgrade score is measured by your squads effectiveness with working together - attacking an objective works towards this , as well as reviving team-mates , etc . if you die your score drops beneath the level needed for the current field upgrade you will see that message . as for if you can see it , for your actual score , i do not know . for the progress to the next field upgrade , it is the bar highlighted below ( sorry for small size ) :
i have seen people mention this a few times and question if the game is broken . its basically that the game is meant to be challenging . a power strike from a two handed weapon does considerable damage to a player and is not something you can normally block . when you see an enemy winding up you pretty much need to get out of the way in one way or another . your options , as i recall , are along the lines of : do something to disrupt their attack a shield bash a shout that can disrupt actions get out of the way raise your hp enough to where you can withstand a large two handed attack . you can lower the difficulty , that will make enemies do less damage so by its very nature you are effectively doing what is last on the list up there just inversely . hope this helps .
yes , it is possible to use the bank without being in a guild . when you approach the bank , the npc in the center is the guild banker , used to access guild-only storage ; to his left and right ( in yellow below ) are two other npcs you can approach , who are the regular bankers , used to access your personal storage .
there are only two possible outcomes to the game , winning , by killing the " priests " at the temple ship , or losing , where 8 nations have left the xcom project . there is another condition , where the volunteer ( the soldier used in the gallop chamber ) must survive the final battle ( temple ship ) . however , if they die during the mission , you will be prompted to reload the game and no cut scene is shown . this happens also when playing in iron-man mode . those are all the endings available .
you start the dlc by using the fast travel system to go to the first area of the dlc . from there , you will receive a new mission and further instructions . these are the areas you are looking for : captain scarlett and her pirate 's booty : oasis mr . torgue 's campaign of carnage : badass crater of badassitude sir hammerlock 's big game hunt : hunter 's grotto tina 's assault on dragon keep : unassuming docks note that you may be restricted from playing dlc by your level and/or story progression .
nethack has secret passages ( blocking corridors ) and secret doors ( embedded in room walls ) . you must find them before you can pass through them . the canonical way of discovery is s earching , but it is not the only one . for example , if you are sure there is an hidden door in a certain square , you can try kicking it . if you are lucky you will find the door , break it and gain some bonus experience points -- iirc . that is all good and fun , but where should you search ? stairs always happen in rooms . thus , you should look for " holes " in the map where a room could fit . if there are dead end corridors in that general direction you might be on the right path ! here 's a real life scenario . i marked some educated guesses with question marks to illustrate my point . 1 looks the most likely : a continuation of a dead end corridor . 2 is also plausible , that large area down there is so likely to have at least two rooms . 3 looks more far fetched , but it is exactly where the hidden door was . i hope this still gives you an idea of how to make reasonable guesses when looking for secret passages . oh , and remember to never ever hold a key when playing nethack . one search is hardly going to be enough , so run the search command multiple times the right , safe way : 2 0 s ( 0 2 0 s if you have numpad on ) will s earch the current position for 20 times only if it is safe enough to do so . hunger , approaching monsters and the like will abort your search , unlike holding a key does .
you can not , for the exact reasons you stated . while it would be possible if one of the ingame traders was willing to trade one , according to the bulbapedia ingame trade list there is no such trader . source : bulbapedia
depending on the mods installed , /butcher [radius] should work . of course , you had need access to the commands to do so .
not in the current version of the alpha ( 16 ) , no . the edge of the map is a protected tile , as are all the tiles of the prebuilt road : i tried adding a road gate to force vehicles to turn right , but this did not help as they just patiently waited for the gate to be opened ( despite my field being in dire need of riot police and the fire brigade ) : however , there is a ( very expensive and time consuming ) workaround . first you need to build two offices . in the first one , appoint a warden and have him research finance from the bureaucracy screen . then hire an accountant and have her research land expansion . in total this will take about 1 in game day . this then gives you the option to purchase land plots on the other side of the prebuilt road for $20,000 a piece . this can be used to give the illusion that the road has been moved and gives you your desired road in the middle : you must remember to use road gates to allow a secure space for prisoners to cross the road , if that is your intention .
from all of the research i have pulled in online , the only thing that i could find was this : there is a bonus score multiplier of 8% for each successive kill you make . this is reset if you miss but not after an amount of time has elapsed . it also does not matter if its a headshot , just so long as you kill them in one shot . performing a 2 for 1 bullet kill only adds 8% despite you killing two people in quick succession , not 16% . a land-mine kill will score higher than a trip wire kill . also read somewhere that score depends on how many vital organs you hit with a single shot , but i could not find any evidence to support this . the main three factors seem to be Range , Hit Location and ' number of kills in one shot` . other than that , there does not seem to be an exact formula ( even rough )
if your system can handle it , the following console command . . . r_lod 0 . . . will increase the detail level of the in-game models to match that of the portraits . the actual difference varies from one hero to another . you might get a sharp drop in fps in games with lots and lots of models though ( like phantom lancer or naga siren illusions , meepos , etc ) so you might want to test that out in a bot game or something . the same command with -1 instead of 0 returns you to the default settings .
the launcher will automatically update minecraft to the latest version when you click play … unless you have accidentally told the launcher not to . if the button says play and bottom-right of the launcher says welcome , [ username ] ready to play minecraft 1.6.2 then you have somehow told minecraft to never update past 1.6.2 . fortunately , this is easy to fix . why is this happening ? the launcher has a use version setting in your profile which it uses to decide what version of minecraft to download and launch . by default it is set to " use latest version " , which means it will always check for updates and install them if it finds any . if it is instead set to a specific version of minecraft , it will never try to update to anything else . somehow , your profile has this option set to 1.6.2 , and the launcher is dutifully following the launch orders it is being given . this can also happen if you have modded minecraft and have set up the profile to launch the modded version . ( forge 's installer sets up such a profile for you automatically . ) in this case , not updating is because " a modded version " is a specific version of minecraft . forge sets up the profile this way on purpose since an update will wipe out forge and disable your mods , which is not usually something you want the launcher to do to your carefully-modded game when mojang releases an update . updating to the latest version you can change the use version option by clicking the edit profile button in the bottom left of the launcher . set it to " use latest version " and then click save profile . the profile editing window will close and now in the bottom right the launcher should say welcome [ username ] ready to download and play minecraft 1.6.4 if this does not happen or the big button says play offline you may not be online or mojang 's servers may be having trouble . make sure you have a working internet connection and double-check that mojang 's servers all show a healthy " green " status . if their servers are not working right , you will just have to wait until they are back online and can serve your update request properly again . i see " release 1.6.4" in that option . why not choose that ? you can also set this to " release 1.6.4" to accomplish the same thing . . . for now . you will get the same problem next time minecraft updates , though . unless you know what you are doing , do not set this to anything other than " use latest version " .
meow-oui . yes to the latter question , but you can skip the ones you do not like on your later playthroughs ( d : oh air robo gp , how i loathe thee ) . all quests are mandatory , but the order you complete them in is not . the wifi/dlc quests ( already preloaded on the na versions ) are optional . there should be ~80 quests or so . it is suppose to give you the feel for the atmosphere of the game ( such as the fun dialogues ) . do not miss out on the tail concerto cameos !
according to serebii .netpikachu has a 5% chance to hold a light ball ( the same as black 2/white 2 ) .
like this contrived example ( but the other way around ) ? best is your " previous best " ( and does not include this run , so you can compare ) . this is the result of this run . so if you are seeing this:172 and best:214 this implies you have just managed a faster solution that your previous best , next time you will see best:172 because lower elapsed cycles are better .
barring an update from blizzard that seems , to be frank , incredibly unlikely , the only way to play diablo ii on your mac is to run an older operating system . either natively , such as windows via boot camp , or simply having an install of 10.6 on another partition , or through virtualization software like vmware or parallels . sorry to be the bearer of bad news .
there is no single dps number that i have seen ( only about 45 minutes play time ) , much like borderlands . instead , you have got to look at multiple stats and make a judgement call based on personal preferences . as with borderlands , i expect that taking things for a spin will be really important when it is a close call . in addition to the stats you see when you mouse over a weapon , there are at least a few hidden stats : zoom level ( present in borderlands 1 ) , recoil , and stability . shooting down a sight impacts dps , obviously , and stability is a major factor there . recoil will affect dps when firing rapidly/burst . it is not always desirable to shoot as fast as possible ( even when not using scopes/iron sights ) . i think it is just impractical to include a dps calculation . i do wish borderlands weapon " cards " showed more stats though . stability is really important for sniping , for example .
is this the quote you are looking for : " graa is dead . but , his secret lies with his remains , in the crypt of abandon . you have come of age adam . you must do what your father has never been willing to do . before i depart this world , i want to give you this shell . it is an object of power . with it you can call out to me in the valley of mists . if it is in my power to help you , i will . it is time , the ancestors beckon me . farewell children . " this dialogue is spoken near the beginning of the game by dina 's father , tau , while explaining to adam the importance of his coming of age .
daily quests are reset at 3 am server time , which will differ based on your currently set battle .netregion , and which specific server you connect to : the numbers below may vary . for the north american region , servers are typically on pst ( -7 gmt ) , which means that currently ( as the us is in daylight savings time ) it will reset at 10 am gmt . for the european region , servers are typically on cet ( +1 gmt ) , which means that they will reset at 2 am gmt . for the asian region , servers are typically on kst ( +9 gmt ) , which means that they will reset at 6 pm gmt .
it seems minamimoto 's is the best solution . last year i bought rock band 2 special edition ( bundle with one guitar , one mic and one set of drums ) for $99 on gamestop , but they do not seem to be making that deal at the moment ( at least not online ) . on amazon , it is $113 . the beatles instruments are prettier , so i think this set is worth the extra buck . as for the other instruments , consider getting lips . at $30 , they come with 2 wireless microphones . harmonix is only selling one rock band 3 bundle , with the keyboard controller , so i guess you do not have much of a choice there . and it is sold out at amazon , which is even worse . as for the cymbals , both rb2 cymbals and the new pro cymbals are being sold by the same price , $40 . the only issue is that the new cymbals will only be released on october 30th . according to a review , the new cymbals are much superior , so it might be worth the wait . the only thing missing is the guitar . there are several options . you could pick a rb2 wireless guitar for $60 , not much to go wrong there . with $20 more , you could get the beatles guitar , which could be nice if you get the rest of the set . if you prefer the guitar hero controller , it would be the cheapest option , at $50 . and , for $70 , you can get the guitar hero : warriors of rock guitar bundle . you will be spending at least $360 on all this stuff . but your parties are never gonna be the same . :- ) edit : ah , and if you want to crank it up to eleven , get this setup .
for the purpose of achievements , you can backtrack by loading previous chapters via the menu . play game > load chapter . this only works for the ' eavesdropper ' and ' sightseer ' achievements however . the last collectible achievement ' infused with greatness ' must be completed on a single playthrough so if you can remember the first infusion that you missed you can load that chapter and play to the end , getting all of the infusions and it will pop .
a few simple tactics : if you are ambushing somebody , make sure to have a splash poison potion ( i or ii ) , as they ignore armour , which can be extraordinarily helpful against opponents with enchanted armour . it does not kill them , though , only brings them to half a heart ! this tactic is also useful is you are turning round to face a pursuer . enchantments are also an excellent way to defend yourself and increase your attacking potential . a fire aspect enchantment on your sword is a great alternative to a poison potion , but it can be harder to find as it is not a guarantee that you will enchant it on the first go . make sure to also keep up your defensive enchantments , though ! if you are currently in a melee battle , try and circle+jump around your opponent whilst spamming your left click . this is a common tactic though , so expect your opponent to do it as well ! the jumping ensures you will get critical hits , which can get you up to 50% extra damage ! try and switch directions often though , as it is easy to counter by simply hitting a bit in front of where you actually are . it can be a lot easier to kill them with a bow , which negates the danger of the enemy quickly wearing down your health , unless they are a better shot than you . you can shoot them a few times before entering melee combat , as they will enter with slightly diminished health . if you have a fire aspect enchantment on your bow , then they will enter slowly burning to death . it is also a great way to finish off a fleeing enemy . if you are on the defensive , remember to block/parry ! you simply hold right click facing an enemy , and the attacks only do half damage . this does not decrease durability on the sword .
there are three methods of conversion : organic , missionaries , and priests . organic conversion : organic conversion involves a system called " pressure " . any city with a dominant religion within 10 [ 1 ] tiles exerts 6 [ 2 ] pressure . if a city has pressure from a religion , it will slowly convert to that religion . if it has pressure from multiple religions , it will try and balance citizens between them . a city with 12 pressure from christianity and 6 from shinto will gradually become 2/3 christian and 1/3 shinto . missionaries : missionaries are purchased with 200 [ 3 ] faith , and will have the same religion as the city they are produced in ; if your empire is mostly catholic , and you have a protestant city , that one city will make protestant missionaries . they can be used 2 [ 4 ] times to spread religion . this converts a number of citizens , based on several factors . . . how many citizens already have that religion , how large the city is , the strength of the missionary . . . inquisitors : inquisitors are purchased for 200 [ 3 ] faith , and they allow you to remove followers that are opposed to the inquisitor 's religion from your city , once . ( they do not work in opponents ' cities . ) this can make a minority religion into a majority religion . the inquisitor 's religion is the same as the city it was produced in , regardless of your empire 's religion . in general , inquisitors are not to be used for converting cities , though they can be used to quickly convert a conquered city to your religion if there is at least one follower of your religion in the city . instead , inquisitors should be used to prevent the enemy from converting your cities . if one of your cities is experiencing high pressure from hinduism , you can use an inquisitor to remove all traces of the infidels from your city . that buys you enough time to build support near that city , preventing the godless heretics from returning . in my play , i have been using inquisitors rarely when compared to missionaries . if you are not the dominant religion , you will not be using inquisitors to convert someone else . great prophets : great prophets can be used like stronger missionaries and also function as inquisitiors , who have 4 uses and higher strength . they also do not suffer from attrition while in hostile territory , unlike missionaries notes : [ 1 ] : there is an enhancement changing the reach to 13 tiles [ 2 ] : based on game speed . slower games means lower base pressure values ( 4 for epic , 2 for marathon ) there is an enhancement to increase the pressure values by 34% ( and later 68% ) , rounded down . [ 3 ] : scales with game speed and era . there is an enhancement to reduce this faith cost by 20% . [ 4 ] : there is an wonder ( great mosque of djenne ) changing this to 3 , for inquisitors built in the wonder 's city . tl ; dr : to convert other cities , use just missionaries . missionaries are offensive , inquisitors are defensive .
as soon as the merchant restocks , anything you have sold them disappears . at this point , pc players who want to " buy " it back can simulate this with the console with two commands . you will first have to find the internal item id of the mask and its gold value , which you can look up at skyrim artifacts ( beware spoilers ! ) in the " id " and " coin " columns . armed with these two numbers ( save first ! always make a new save first ) , open the console ( ~ on us keyboards ) and type : additem ItemIDGoesHere 1 removeitem 0000000f MaskValueGoesHere  the first line adds 1 of whatever item id you give it in ItemIDGoesHere , which should be the id of the mask you want to " buy " back . the second line removes a number of gold equal to MaskvalueGoesHere ( gold is item id 0000000f ) . make sure you have enough gold to remove before you go removing it ! ( probably it would just reduce your gold carried to 0 instead of anything bad , but why tempt fate ? ) for example , to get volsung back , you would type : additem 00061cab 1 removeitem 0000000f 4611  if you want to be super-correct about this , you can try to calculate your current vendor buying percentage and adjust the value upward . or , if you do not want to " buy " it and just want it back , you can entirely skip the command that removes the gold from your inventory . it is a single-player game , so whatever feels appropriate to you , do that .
caverns are great resource areas . in a typical first level cavern you will find fungi for food , tower caps for logs , spider silk , water , and large open areas that are muddied already and make excellent dwarven farms . my brother has taken to actually building his dwarf fort in the first cavern because all the resources you need are basically right there . the first cavern is pretty safe , i have not seen anything nasty come out of it . the second cavern can get a bit nasty . i have an army of 10 wrestlers i sent down there and lost 1 while they were clearing out the first wave of critters . but note that the second cavern also contains lava . i have not breached the third cavern yet . but you can imagine the trend . the deeper you go , the scarier it becomes . in short , the answer to your question is resources . caverns are a large economic boost to your fort . the critters are a small nuisance in comparison to the value you get out of the caverns .
no , the n7:cerberus attacks mission is not internally time-sensitive . you and your crew can dilly-dally all day long before you rescue those ungrateful civilians . you can refer to the ign guide for that specific mission or the vgfaq mission walkthrough for any concerns you have about timing or , more importantly , hidey holes and stuff to find .
looks like no . considering that battlefield 2142 is the only bf set in the future , it would be hard to expect a battle of massive flying warships in games set in modern times or even in the past . no game that came after bf 2142 contained even a similar mechanic to the titan mode . they mostly focused on conquest and rush .
to get bootmii to work you must first install it with letterbomb . to do this go into the letters section of your wii locate the letterbomb ( it is red and has a bomb sticking out of it ) when you open it select the bootmii installer ( it should be under the homebrew channel ) next time you open bootmii from the home brew channel it should load properly and not get stuck on a black screen . note the wii controller will stop working this is normal you can use the buttons on the wii console to navigate the options . after you settup bootmii the controllers will work again . also if you have started bootmii before installing it from letter bomb and you are stuck on a black screen it is safe to turn of your wii .
it is not possible to skip that step of the character creation as far as i know , but when you finish creating your character and get into the game proper , your " mask " is simply a regular head slot item that you can hide ( or even remove ) at will . the same is also true for the mesmer 's masks .
it is very hard to create a solution to this problem 100% of the time , but there are some tips i can give . for your scenario specifically if you find that you are not able to farm to well then consider some mana regen seals so you can make better use of your abilities to last hit those minions . early laning is all about holding your tower over everything else . if you can not effectivley harass your oponent then do not . let him come to you and ask for a gank . if the issue is that he is farming to well then he most likely pretty over-extended asking to be ganked . however , holding your tower in good standing and making sure you do not get underleveled are more important than harassing the enemy . you will have all game to outplay him , let him have his early game glory . consider who is going to be in what lane when you are chosing your lanes . a lot of champions can sustain better than ryze against brand , but in general brand will always be a pain early game . cait , akali and even if you are feeling daring morde in mid are good counters to brands mid game . also instead of putting your focus in harassing brand put your focus on avoiding his harassing . last hit minions as best as you can and keep your movements frequent and sporadic . a lot of brands moves are skillshots and are very easy to avoid .
diamond skin is classified as an absorption effect , so you can use an armour effect like storm armour along with diamond skin with no problems at all .
here are some general things i have observed from playing with a friend who runs both a wizard and witch doctor ( both glass cannon builds ) . wizard damage sources relies more on critical damage rather than straight up dps , so favors not only int but also crit . witch doctors relies on dps and mob control , and thus does not care as much about crit . since int + crit gear is a lot more expensive than int gear , and since your budget is only 1.5m , i would highly recommend going the wd route . just from a few searches in the ah , i can piece together a fairly decent wd that can tackle up to a2 inferno ( ~40k dps and 25k health ) just by going for the int + vit gears totaling roughly 1.5m . if you want to survive beyond act 2 , you will have to spend 1-2 mill ( minimum ) per piece of gear and go for the really good stuff with res all along with int/vit .

rosalina will join your ship , and you also get a " congratulations ! " message from nintendo sent to your inbox :
there are a few ways to easily deal with the librarians . the pacifist remember what miller tells you about the librarians : they will only attack when provoked . you must maintain eye-contact with them at all times . in other words , keep your cross-hair aimed at his eyes . do not move towards them . that will be an act of aggression and they will attack you . if they do start coming towards you ( not in an aggressive manner ) , slowly walk backwards . when they walk right up to your face and scream and bang their fists , they are just showing their dominance . keep eye contact , remain calm and continue to slowly walk backwards , never towards them . do not turn your back to them ; they will see that as a cowardly act and attack you . once the librarian is done showing off , you can simply walk through their territory . this youtube vid shows the pacifist method the aggressor use the librarian 's animal instincts against them : have your shotgun loaded and ready . allow the librarian to get right up into your face by using the pacifist method . when you see the white their eyes , fire a couple of quick rounds off with the shotgun . should take just a couple to the head , especially when they are so close you can feel their breath on your face . alternate method : if you are paying attention in the library , you will notice a number of arrows in the walls . the arrows are a hint . . . bring a helsing into the library . pump the helsing up to maximum pressure . fire off a few rounds into the librarian . librarian dies . you pick up the arrows and use them on the next beast . remember , librarians are our friends . they are just pissed off that someone screwed up their dewey decimal cards .
i have had no trouble placing my garages . granted , i never played tropico 3 , but i do not consider the garages in tropico 4 to be abnormally large .
the 20x6 simply means each shot has 6 bullets , which has a spread . if all 6 of your fragments hit the target , then the damage will be 120 , or more/less depending on critical , level difference etc . on some guns , like the wave , the rounds come out parallel to each other , making this significantly harder to hit with all your shots .
no- in motorstorm rc , as well as all previous motorstorm games , all the different cars within a specific vehicle type are just aesthetically different . note : the different vehicle types handle differently from game to game , but in each motorstorm game , not the vehicle itself , but the vehicle type determines the stats ( in motorstorm i , big rigs had 4/10 speed . in motorstorm : pacific rift , they had 8/10 speed , meaning the stats for an individual vehicle type vary from game to game ) . all in all , the different vehicles within a class/type are statistically identical , they are just aesthetically different .
no , it is not possible to change your sponsors at will , and completing the sponsor objectives will not allow you to change the sponsors either . you are granted the opportunity to change your sponsors at the start of each world racing series season and during this time you are normally offered additional sponsors and locations on your car to place sponsor logos . you can change your sponsors on the ' my vehicles ' menu under ' customise player livery ' on the ' sponsors ' screen .
here is a little run-down of the possible situation with a short explanation . controllers have 2 ways to communicate : xinput , the modern protocol . almost all modern games ( especially the xbox 360 ports ) will work with these controllers . they usually have " soft " trigger buttons , meaning they replicate the action of real life triggers . also , similar to xbox 360 controllers , they have a home button . usually in the front , between start and select . these controllers use analogue input for some buttons , meaning the buttons ( mostly the triggers ) read data in more precise float point values ( e . g . : 0.165 and 0.734 ) . directinput , the older protocol . older games use this and some modern games ( fighting games always support these , assassin 's creed 2 and brohood etc ) . think of ps2 era controllers . they have regular button triggers and usually no home button . games working with the xinput as their primary input mode usually will not support these controllers . the triggers are using digital input , meaning they have less precise values being sent ( 1 pressed and 0 unpressed ) . ( even steam 's big picture supports this mode , but you will not have access to the steam-in game overlay and screenshot functionality , because you will be missing a home button with this ) after you determine what type of controller you have , you need to see what type of controller your game supports . modern games support almost all the time the xinput method , especially if the game was ported from consoles to pc . they rarely support directinput . the elecom controller seems to be directinput ( the big mode button is not a home button and the triggers are buttons ) . it will not get detected by most modern games . luckily for you , there is a piece of software called x360ce made to emulate xinput for directinput devices . i see that you have used it with no success . download the latest release from here , their official homepage of the project : http://code.google.com/p/x360ce/ and follow the instructions they provide on their site here : http://code.google.com/p/x360ce/wiki/whatisx360ceandhowuseit following that guide properly should make your elecom controller work . the xbox 360 controller should have no issue working with batman : arkham origins , but the official drivers should be installed on the system . i found that just plugging it in is not enough . download them from the official microsoft driver repository here : http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows keep in mind , when you want to use your xbox 360 controller in a xinput only game , unplug the other directinput controllers . games have a tendency to ignore the xbox 360 controller if they detect a directinput controller . i think it has to do with the priority the system is setting to each one of them ( actually this happened to me when i was playing arkham asylum , and i had to unplug my logitech wireless rumblepad 2 and restart the game ) . the same thing applies when you install the xbox 360 controller , remove all other controllers . once you install it , reboot and plug in the others keeping in mind the above mentioned . hope this will help .
an enormous focus in diablo 3 has been placed on increasing the number of viable builds . while each class may excel at some things that the other classes do not ( witch doctor seems to be best at area control and damage over time , wizard seems to be best at ranged aoe , etc . ) , no one class is supposed to be relegated to a specific role . no class has to be the healer , because each class is a fully functional independent unit , capable of sustaining itself and providing its own support . that does not mean that you can not play as a pure support hero , though , if you really want to . healing and defensive monks look to be quite powerful based on their skill descriptions . the distinction here is what the developers call ' viability ' . are there going to be emergent optimal builds that are just plain ' better ' than other builds ? almost certainly . does that mean that all the other builds are completely invalidated because of that ? absolutely not . i am very bad at remembering where i hear a certain piece of information , but to paraphrase something said by either bashiok or jay wilson : if the optimal builds are 5% better than the crazy wonky viable builds that people are using , that is perfectly fine . some people love doing all the mathcraft to come up with that 5% advantage . it is only if there turns out to be some significant advantage that actually hinders the utility of other builds that they have a problem , and those problems will be addressed in balance patches if they emerge . the viability of creative builds is the main focus of the skill system by the devs .
you must play survival first and yes the trophy is awarded after you complete survival+ .
the main thing to purchase would be elixirs . if you purchase an elixir whilst you have all 6 items occupied , you will instead automatically consume the elixir and gain its benefit . the fact that the benefit persists through death is merely icing on the cake for what is otherwise just some extra stat bonus that you do not need item slots for . with 6000g , you can buy a very long duration of elixir benefits . a less savorable option would be to swap out items for other options . perhaps to account for a shift in how the battle is going , or to try out a new strategy . usually , if you are swimming in gold , though , you do not need a new strategy . nevertheless , sometimes you think that swapping for , say , a more push-oriented item in order to just end the game , for example .
i have yet to see anything other than move away as an effective grenade counter . this opinion is borne out by several more days of game play , the recipe for not-shepard-pie is move it , move it , move it ! !
nope . you do not need to write them down . in the top right corner , second from the right , you can click on that icon to give you a summary of your current contracts . as you fulfill conditions , the little clock icon will turn into a green checkmark . if you fulfill the root objective ( ie . test a certain rocket , deploy a certain part ) once all the sub-objectives have green checkmarks , that will mark the contract complete .

if you are willing to carry a door on you , the quickest shelter you can throw up is to just dig a 1x2 hole into the side of any hill and throw down a door to seal it off . if you do not have a door i suggest the following :  \u2593\u2593\u2593 \u2593\u2593\u2593 \u2593\u2592\u2593 top down view \u2593\u2592\u2593 \u2593\u2592\u2593\u2593 \u2593 2 rocks \u2593\u2592\u2022\u2593 \u2592 1 rock \u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593 \u2022 you  the key thing here is that by being off to the side you are not in range of arrows , but you still maintain a path to light so you can see the sun up ( you can also listen for music , but i often disable sound ) . you close off the entrance with single rocks so you leave a 1x1 path which zombies can not come down .
if your friend is running lion or later , 10.7+ , the library folder is hidden . open " terminal " ( located at /applications/utilities ) and execute this command ( shows all hidden folders and files ) : defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE then in " terminal " use this command to close your find process : killall Finder restart finder and all hidden folders should now be visible . now , in finder , click on your user folder , then library , then application support . your minecraft folder is listed here . to hide hidden files/folders in finder execute this command in terminal ( then restart finder ) : defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE alternatively , you can execute this command from terminal to open your " application support " folder in a finder window : open ~/Library/Application\ Support/
there are chances where the follower is stuck in a position , could be this or also in fighting stance . normally the best way is to load a saved game before this happened instead of continuing to play since there is a chance that this is not possible to fix . other options would be to do something that resets the position . i would try to use the fus-roh-dah on her to throw her over . she will then have to get up again form the floor . the change of stance needs a trigger . so to sheath the weapons or to get up from crawling , there needs to be a change in situation that causes the trigger . if the system overlooks one trigger , the follower is stuck in the stance . you have to re-initiate a trigger to change the stance again . i am not sure what kind of attack would work since i am not sure how the follower would normally react to an attack while crawling . however a fus-ro-dah normally topples players over completely and then initiates the " get up from the ground " movement , and i am quite sure that if you manage to topple her over , she will not get into the crawling stance .
as it turns out , when you unlock the geneticist ( which i did at about 135/150 ) you also unlock the " gene pool " building . mine is still under construction , but i can update more after it is built if things are not completely obvious from there . and incase you are wondering how to make a geneticist : scientist + doctor = geneticist
there are some generic npcs that you gain by completing quests , such as the dark brotherhood initiate that may respawn , assuming you can somehow kill them in the first place . it seems that those initiates are immortal , according to the wiki . so no , you can not run out of followers .
it depends . if you have a straight line of sight to the fusebox , you can use the remote electrical charge to shoot them and overload them . a lot of them do not offer a straight line of sight though . in those cases , you would use the remote-controlled batarang , assuming you can give it an electrical charge . you will want to look around for sparks/arcs of electricity . you will have to throw your batarang , get it charged by flying it through the electricity , and then guide it to the fuse box . some of these can be pretty complex , you will have to reverse course on the batarang sometimes , and fly through some tight areas .
according to this walkthough : observe the statues and the fireplace . this is a puzzle . lawrence made a note about something like this . press select to open nate 's journal . four knights , with an axe , a shield , a sword , and a morning star . just like the ones in this room . you have got to turn each knight so it is facing the right way . adjust the knights ' position to match the the direction they are facing in the journal . the suit of armor thats holding the shield should face the one holding an axe . the knight holding the axe should face the knight with the shield , and the same for the one holding the mace . the knight holding the sword should face the knight holding the axe .
another option for removing debris is to limit how much of it you want to keep around . one of the settings allows you to choose anywhere from no debris , to unlimited debris . this option is available under settings in the main menu ( the menu you see when first starting the game , not the in-game menu ) , and is called max persistent debris . keep in mind this setting only handles debris from not controlled flights ; it will not automatically kill everything that gets detached from your current launch . that only happens when you end the flight , or switch to the space center . not quite what you were asking for , but the only other option , yes , is to intercept each and every piece , and manually de-orbit it .
it works exactly the same as a helm ruby . both items increase the " bonus experience %" stat on the character sheet . despite the somewhat confusing name , this is a % increase to the base experience gained for each kill .
the cheat codes menu within the game is for players who pre-ordered the game from various retailers . these codes only work in splitscreen multiplayer , and are only exclusive to these pre-orders until the end of the year . bestbuy : " tag mode " - the person " tagged " cannot kill until they are no longer " it . " gamestop : " invisibility mode " - each player can go invis for a small period of time to sneak up on other players . it has not been stated yet how players can obtain these codes after this time . no other cheats have been released at the time of this posting .
the gunzerker 's quick draw skill does this : quick draw - tier 1: gives you +7% weapon swap speed and +2% critical hit damage per level . his gun lust tree has a couple other skills that take effect on weapon swap too , so if you like constantly changing weapons he is your man . i am not aware of any relics or class mods that affect reload speed ( though a com with + quick draw would do the trick ) slag is really best as a grenade or when there are other players , so swapping is not necessary , but if you really think it is worth it , salvador 's got the best skills for swapping . of course the siren has better skills for actually inflicting slag , if you really just want to inflict slag i would say maya 's flicker is more helpful . also note weapon swap speed is a hidden stat for the gun . you may just be using guns with horrible swap speed ; rocket launchers in particular are bad for that , pistols swap quite quickly . not sure if there are brand differences in that regard .
probably just grind normal . consider the d3 difficulty chart ( click for full size ) : also at the bottom of this page since gear on your barb at end game should be legendaries , and you do not get legendary bonus drop chance until torment 1 , your best bet is generally to clear normal quickly until you can handle torment 1 . actually , if you look even closer , the only bonuses you get from normal up to master are : bonus xp bonus gold find bonus death 's breath and legendary crafting mats master gives imperial gems on occasion expert and above give double bounty blood shards with this in mind , i would never run hard . if you are interested in getting blood shards from bounties , then expert or master might be worthwhile - as long as it does not take you twice as long to finish a run . the rest of the bonuses are nice , but generally not worth it until you get to torment 1 .
unfortunately , you can not just by looking at the case . example of a game with multiple optional peripherals : ( original ) game that requires the motion plus and nunchuck : ( original ) the only way to be 100% certain is to look up the game online and double check .
pokemon always breed into the lowest tier of the evolution . * this means that mated pairs of both politoed and poliwrath will produce poliwag eggs . all four pokemon have the same moves available " via breeding " , which makes sense , given the above . * unless the requirements for a " baby " pokemon form is not met , in which case they will be the next-evolved form .
no , attempting and failing to pick up an item off the ground does not make it visible to others , as though you had dropped it . it stays private to you . i have seen this demonstrated in a co-op game before .
or . . to get the quest off the books , bring console up with ~ ( tilde ) , type " setstage dunblindcliffqst 100" and this finishes the quest and sets it as completed .
certain characters are more shrewd than others and can figure out if they have been stolen from and who did it . one of my favourite examples is anise ( the lady with the shack near riverwood ) . she is sent guards to all 3 of my characters . there is no penalty later on if you decide to talk to them , they will act like it never happened ( i think , or maybe they will dislike you more , but it is basically the same ) . i have also only ever had one set of thugs from each person , even if i continue to steal from them .
in the case of this particular ' door ' , you can access the other side easily enough by walking through the centaur village ' modniir gorge ' to the north . you walk down a pathway into a cave and can stand on the other side of the ' door ' and look back into hidden ourobon . not sure why they would put a short cut between the village and hidden ourobon or how you open it but seems more likely to be tied to an event rather than a future portal imho .
yes . you can play songs in practice mode ( same thing you get when practicing a scroll before learning it ) with the song 's full pattern via the bonus menu . from the main menu , select " bonus " . in this menu , you can listen to all the songs you have unlocked so far . if a song has an arrow pattern , there will be an up arrow button between the next/previous buttons . clicking that ( or hitting 1 ) starts the song in practice mode .

it might be difficult to completely answer your question , but i can provide some considerations . which games do you want to play ? if they are fairly old ( 3-4 years ) and your graphics card is new , then usually investing in more ram helps . are you ok with poor graphics ? dialing down the graphics settings , anti-aliasing , anisotropic filtering , far distance , greatly improves fps . does your motherboard support the upgrades that you want ? usually old motherboards will not be fully compatible with newer gpus etc . they could have an older bus which could lead to reduced performance . they could have memory expansion limitations , even if they have extra slots . have a look at this question to determine point 1 .
so you are trying to get to the circled part or the part near the pointer ? there is no trick to reaching that spot , just slide in that direction and you should be able to reach the vent normally . if in doubt , you may still run through the slopes as long as you are on your own two feet . if you are sliding , then well , you will not be able to get up and run until you hit level ground . if you can get to the other set of rocks on the other side , you can jump off and sprint toward the vent . but like i said , you do not really need to do anything special as you should have been able to reach it normally .
the location of that meter is reserved weapons with a unique functionality which require an additional bar . it is functionality varies from weapon to weapon , and does not even exist for some weapons . other weapons will have something else in it is place which is not a meter at all . the weapons which make use of that spot are : dual sword : demon gauge . to be honest , i am not that familiar with the dual swords , so i would suggest looking into this video tutorial for more information . the basic idea is that dual swords can enter something called demonization mode , which gives you additional combos and improves you attacks . when you hit monsters in demon mode the meter fills up , and so long as the meter is not empty you will do extra damage and attack faster when not in demon mode . long swords : spirit gauge . once again , i am not that familiar with the long sword , so i will refer you to here for more information . attacks with a long sword fill up the spirit gauge . once the spirit gauge is full , spirit attacks ( made with the r button ) no longer cost spirit . a spirit combo performed while the spirit gauge is full will have a finishing attack called the spirit roundslash . your hunter will automatically sheathe his/her weapon after performing a roundslash and receive a minor damage boost . landing the spirit roundslash will also increase the grade of the spirit gauge ( white -> yellow -> red ) . higher grades of the spirit gauge will provide higher damage boosts while degrading quicker . bowguns / gunlance : these weapons require ammunition , and they use this spot to displays how much ammo is remaining in the weapons clip . switch axe : phial meter . the switch axe has two modes , axe and sword , and every switch axe has a phial . axe mode generates phial energy , and sword mode consumes it . the functionality of the phial varies from axe to axe , but are only active when in sword mode . for example , a power phial will boost the raw ( physical ) damage you do . the phial meter displays how much phial energy you have left . hunting horn : note meter . the hunting horn produces a musical note with every attack , which are displayed in the note meter . some sequences of notes allow the hunting horn to play a song by pressing the r button , which gives the the user and nearby allies a temporary buff . their are a variety of buffs , including healing , attack boosts , and giving users infinite stamina .
you need to have completed the adventure mode once . and then in level 4-10 it will appear . if you kill it , then it will randomly appear throughout the game . ( source )
according to this xbox support page , you can use the parental controls to restrict purchases , but only for a child account . i am not at home and can not verify this right now , but you should be able to create a new profile , designate it as a child account , and set that profile to sign in automatically . you can switch to your main profile when you want to make a purchase or play a game . not an optimal solution , but it is all i can think of .
since you just wanted to hide nei , press o ( deafult ) to disable and hide all nei features . pressing it again brings it back up . the reason the backpacks are remaining is probably a bug in communication between forestry and nei ( no item type , label , etc )
items are shared across all your characters . if you unlock a weapon or mod in a weapon pack , you can add them to all your multiplayer characters .
when you purchase a vehicle of this type , you pay some initial cost that varies . whenever you want to use said vehicle , you call pegasus and for $1k they will deliver it to you .
he was not able to identify the item because he did not know how to do so properly . all characters can identify all rare items .
i played the first one through and loved it . i am now playing witcher 2 and loving it as well . if your concern is the plot and back-story , i think you will do fine just reading the plot summary on wiki as far as importing a save game , it carries over a little bit of money and gear , but nothing that gives a huge advantage . you will have earned more money and better gear in a few hours anyway . the biggest issue i can think of is in understanding the mindset of the character , the game , and the world . the witchers are powerful warriors like you had find in other games , but that is not what makes them interesting/unique . their specialties are knowledge of the many exotic monsters and their alchemy with potions ( and traps and bombs in this case ) . reading/researching about creatures would be optional codex/lore in another game , but here it is part of the quests themselves . potions , bombs , traps would be optional consumables in another game - and i personally rarely use them - but here they are critical . many people are struck by the difficulty of the game , and it is usually because they are trying to sword-fight their way through everything . if you really make use of the traps , bombs , potions , oils , etc . you should do just fine . lastly , understand that the character geralt is not trying to be a heroic soldier . unlike in comparable rpgs , you are neither a great hero nor villain , just something like a tough exterminator travelling from village to village cleaning up their monster infestations . getting caught up in politics and wars is anathema to the cynical witcher who just wants to be on his way to the next job .
ores and ingots are only useful for smithing , though if you find a transmute spell you can turn iron and silver ore into gold , which is useful if you need some money . you can also sell ores to mine owners ( usually they will only buy the type of ore their mines carry ) at their full base price ( unadjusted by your speechcraft skill , which is favorable ) , except for iron , which goes for 7 gold , while its base price is only 2 . also , a few quests will require ore or ingots , but they are too few and far apart to justify the extra weight . most , if not all of them , will be for gold or silver , so a quick trip to a blacksmith for iron ore and a few transmute spells will do the trick .
as raven dreamer notes in the comments , the skeleton key is an unbreakable lockpick : that is pretty much its only purpose ( and a fine purpose that is ! ) . however , if you want to continue on with the quest chain , you must return the key to complete the quest . but be sure to take out as many locks as you have before you do !
i had this same thought . but actually the three " classes " on the far right are race/class combinations , and so you have to unlock all three of them before the siege of lothlorien will become unlocked . better explanation containing spoilers below those three classes are the " monster " classes : gorgon , half-dragon , and vampire . when you select them , your choice of races on the top is ignored , and they are colored gray the same as the other races , so they are effectively both a race and a class .
it is a random spawn in the weeping hollow zone . whenever diablo 3 generates a zone it populates it with the appropriate scenery plus a certain number of events and/or dungeons . the den of the fallen is one of these - a two level dungeon , generally with a selection of rare monsters , champion packs or resplendent chests on the second level . to return to it , you will need to explore the weeping hollow repeatedly until it spawns again .
first one : do you really love candies ? ( answer in english ) correct answer : " yes " ( just like in candy box 1 ) alternatives : " y " , " yeah " , " yeap " , " yep " reward : 20 candies now complete this sequence of letters and you will get a new reward : s , e , i , d , n , a , ? correct answer : " c " ( it is candies spelled backwards ) alternatives : " letter c " , " the letter c " reward : 100 candies next question : how many candies does the candiest person in the world possess ? correct answer : [ however many candies you have currently ] reward : 500 candies in an ancient forest grows a very old tree , on which live the most intelligent animals in this world . it is said that this tree has 60 roots , 360 branches and 2160 leaves . how many marks can you find on its trunk ? correct answer : "10" ( the squirrel is talking about the tree that he is on ) alternatives : " ten " , "10 marks " , " ten marks " reward : 3 lollipops under a full moon , i throw a yellow hat into the red sea . what happens to the yellow hat ? correct answer : " it gets wet , " or " it floats " alternatives : " wet " , " it becomes wet " , " it become wet " , " becomes wet " , " become wet " , " it get wet " , " its wet " , " it got wet " , " it is wet " , " it is wet now " , " its wet now " , " float " , " floats " , " its floating " , " it is floating " , " floating " , " it float " reward : 3 chololate bars the game is tic-tac-toe . we play on a 3 by 3 game board . you will use the x sign while i will use the o sign . we place our signs alternatively , and the goal is to get three signs in a row . i will let you go first ! correct answer ( solution ) : first go in the middle square , then any corner , then get three in a row by going outside of the grid reward : a key to open one of the locked houses in the village
a pick made of iron will mine all ores . a wood or stone pick will only mine coal , iron , and lapis ; but will destroy gold , diamond , redstone and emerald without dropping the item . the diamond pickaxe is the only pickaxe to get obsidian .
you cannot get back there without console commands . the console command you are looking for is " coc " and you will probably need to do it again to get out . use coc skuldafn02 to get there . the codes for skuldafn are skuldafn01 trough skuldafn04 . 02 should put your back in the skuldafn temple . coc whiterun might bring you back home . not sure about the last one .
we found him in one of the structures around the pipeline in the arid nexus ; i will try and find the location 's name tonight . he was in a random hyperion ammo/cash chest on top of the building . it appears he spawns randomly ; i found him in a coop game once , then searching the area again solo i failed to find him . sidenote , in coop he only counts for the single player that deal the killing blow . share with your buddies or farm him solo ; if you seriously want to max out the challenge it'll take a long time . i have also found him in one of the loot midget boxes in the wildlife exploitation preserve ( there is 4 of them near the place where you first try to find bloodwing , with the shielded pens ) . i think he might spawn anywhere a hyperion loot midget ( lwt loader , loot gun loader midget , loot jet loader midget ) can spawn .
those stats are an approximation of a champion 's overall ability , and do not imply any base stats in particular . the game does not use them for any calculations . in general , a champion with a high " attack " bar will be expected to have effective autoattacks ( or will deal a lot of physical damage through abilities ) , one with a high " health " bar will take a lot of hits , one with high " magic " will deal a lot of damage with abilities , and one with high " difficulty " may take a little longer to get used to . in particular , " attack " includes things like base attack damage , base attack speed , and any abilities that enhance basic attacks , such as tristana 's rapid fire or fiora 's riposte . it also considers abilities which deal physical damage , so ad casters like pantheon have a high rating as well . since champions tend not to deal much damage without being in range , gap closers ( like rengar 's unseen predator ) or a high attack range also may contribute . " health " includes not only a champion 's base health , but also their armor , magic resistance , and abilities that protect or sustain one 's self , like shen 's feint , a self-shield . " magic " usually represents either high magic damage with abilities over a period of time , such as ryze , or high burst damage with abilities , such as leblanc . thus , it considers not only the base damage and ap/ad ratios on each ability , but also cooldowns and mana costs ( or lack thereof ) . " difficulty " is very rough , though champions with more skillshots ( like ezreal ) and champions with unique mechanics that can be hard to master ( like orianna ) will have a higher rating . interactions between abilities also can drive up a champion 's difficulty . a champion with high " difficulty " may have a high skill floor ( minimum skill required to begin to be effective ) , a high skill cap ( maximum skill before further improvement with the champion is no longer possible ) , or both .
my advice would be to just get the official ( madkatz ) instruments , which all come bundled with rock band 2 special edition ( you can easily find it for under $100 ) . only if you become really good at one of the instruments is it worth it to dish it out for one of the more expensive , better quality , unofficial controllers . there is also a matter of the official " pro-" controllers - these are not the same controllers better built , but rather new controllers ( or addons to old controllers ) which are necessary to play the new " pro mode " added in rock band 3 , which was just released at the end of october 2010 . the pro-mode controllers are ( all of this is only for rock band 3 ) : the keyboard , an actual functioning midi-keyboard . it can only be played with rock band 3 . in normal mode , you only use 5 keys , playing on the usual green-red-yellow-blue-orange track . in pro mode , you play the melody ( treble ) portion of the song , so it is almost like playing the actual song on the keyboard . ( there are keyboard bundles for xbox 360 and wii which come with both the keyboard and rb3 . for whatever reason , there is no bundle for ps3 : ( ) the pro cymbals , an addon to the rb2/rb3 drumset which adds cymbals . see how do cymbals work in rock band ? for more info . you do not need these to play drums in rock band 3 , only to play drums in pro mode . the pro guitars , the mustang and the squier . the mustang is a true " guitar-controller , " with 200-some buttons along the fret board , one for each fret and string , along with 6 real strings on the body for the players to pluck . in pro-mode , the player is asked to play the actual song on guitar . as cool as this sounds , even cooler is the squier : it is an actual guitar , made by fender , which can be used to control the game . it functions as a midi guitar ( midi guitars have been sold for a long time , but are typically much more expensive than the squier 's $280 price tag . existing and future midi-guitars will require the midi pro adapter in order to be used as a controller ) . from the accounts i have heard , the mustang is alright , but unless you are truly impatient you should just skip the mustang and wait for the squier if you want to play rock band 3 pro guitar .
yes . it does stack . member of wiki discovered . search in-page for word stack and you will see : http://pixeldungeon.wikia.com/wiki/thread:3013 rings appear to stack ( besides ring of haggler ) . . . with two rings of mending + 2 , natural regeneration is more than doubled . without the two rings , the hp regen appears to be +1 per 10 ticks ( wait actions ) . with 1 ring the hp regen is +1/7 ish , and with 2 rings , the hp regen is a little faster than +1/5 . the rings appear to have no effect when starving .
there are magazines which improve the durability of the base items , such as sports , construction , entertainment , and toy items but , it does not look like there is any books that improve the durability of combo weapons . weapons that are improved have a small green book icon on the lower right corner of the weapon icon , and the durability affect is stackable ( ie . having a book that improves bladed weapons , and a book that improves sports items , will make broadswoards , and battleaxes durability increase 9 times that of normal , as each book triples the durability , and they stack ) .
if it are down stairs carved out using designate ( this is your problem ) you need to channel out the stairs . beware that if the tile above has a up/down stairs your dwarf might fall 2 z-levels and break his leg , or neck . try to get the mining dwarf to the current floor first , mind you need a pickaxe for channeling . now you need to construct a up/down or up stair on that level manually . " b"-"c " and pick your stairs from the menu and place it there . any mason will come and bring a stone or brick with him to create a stairs . if it are constructed stairs ( just adding this since it is relevant ) you can remove constructions in the designate menu " d " . not sure about the specific key but you can look it up in the designate list . i think it is " x " . now with the down stairs gone you can use the same method as above ( 2 . ) to construct a new stairs using construct " b"-"c " .
the chemicals can be found in the mission n7: fuel reactor . head up to the left area at the start , on a datapad that overlooks the radiation below you . it can also be purchased from the spectre requisitions office if you did not find it during the mission . once acquired , return to the hospital and speak to the salarian doctor , whose name is dr silon , to complete the mission . completion gives you 5 reputation , 30 experience and 1000 credits . it also updates the alliance first fleet war asset . for a video walkthrough , click here click here for the source .
this was related to the dimensional doors mod , and it is now resolved with newer versions ( i am running 1.3.2 with my install of big dig and it is all fine , and mobs are back ) . reference can be found here .
no , it is not possible . to activate a game on steam that you purchased from a third party , two things need to happen : you must be provided with a cd key from the third-party retailer . it must be a game for which steam accepts third-party cd keys . when you buy a game ( or any other software ) on the mac app store , you are not provided with a cd key , since the mas itself handles product activation . ( apple 's requirement is that all software sold on the mas uses apple 's activation methods . cd keys and the like are disallowed . )
the reaper of souls update has substantially modified this process . there are 4 different machines that can be created which correspond to the particular fights to obtain a particular organ . no more opening 3 portals to guarantee seeing the uber you need . act 1: fields of misery : odeg - the key of bones act 2: dahlgur oasis : sokahr - the key of gluttony act 3: stonefort : xah'rith - the key of war act 4: silver spire level one : nekarat - the key of evil the infernal machine plan can drop from any of the keywardens and they all have a small chance to spawn a second key that is not particular to them . to craft one of the 4 machines you only require the appropriate key and 100,000 gold coins . the level 70 hellfire ring requires 4 organs , the new crafting plan which costs 5,000,000 gold coins from squirt in act 2 and 50,000 coins to craft . the organs are : vial of putridness ( infernal machine of gluttony ) leoric 's regret ( infernal machine of bones ) idol of terror ( infernal machine of war ) heart of evil ( infernal machine of evil ) it is still possible to obtain the original keys while you are level 60 and to craft the level 60 hellfire ring as per the legacy information that used to be contained in answers here ( you can see that info from reviewing edits on the top answers ) . it is not possible to stack the level 60 and 70 hellfire rings to obtain an 80% experience gain bonus . it is not confirmed that the organs drop with the same rate as the keys . they pop only in torment difficulties . the rates are listed in this answer .
enchanting ! the unbreaking enchantment will make your tools last longer by adding a chance that using it will not decrease its durability . repairing ! placing two of the same tool in the crafting window will combine them into one item with 10% ( of the original maximum ) more uses ! the two original tools must also be made of the same material . warning : repairing enchanted items will cause any enchantments to vanish !
you do not receive experience for a missed shot . you do gain experience on every successful hit ( does not have to be enemy ! ) . the more damage you do , the more experience you gain . a kill also gives you a bit of experience bonus ( judging by how much the bar moves ) . the best part of leveling archery is that you do not have to hit an enemy to get experience , you can make target practice on your summoned minions , such as a familiar or zombie . just summon one , shoot at it , then repeat . there are also 3 archery trainers in skyrim that can improve your skill for gold : faendal in riverwood ( journeyman , level 0 - 50 ) . you can effectively train with faendal for free , if you gain him as a follower through the quest " a lovely letter " . aela the huntress in whiterun ( expert , level 0 - 75 ) .

no , you cannot return to the original ' easy ' castle . however , if you find ng+ difficult : equip grace runes . grace runes lower the level of the monsters making them easier to kill . in the early levels of ng+ grace runes also turn the tier 2 enemies back into thier tier 1 form . this can effectively turn the castle back to it is ' easy ' form for a while .
advantages of human form are that you can kindle camp fires and summon phantoms to aid you . these abilities are not available in hollow form . the only disadvantage is you are risking black phantom invasions .
they specifically advertise the game as being able to be played forever because of its infinite quests , so yes , you can play until the end of time .
batman : arkham city patches via games for windows live if you are not using steam . when you log into gfwl , you will be informed that a patch is available , and then it will be installed . note that just because a steam patch is out , it does not mean that the same patch has hit gfwl ; depending on the publisher/developer 's release schedule , it may be delayed . i would recommend being patient , and if you are having trouble , to go ask on the official forums , where rocksteady community managers are providing support . this is the official thread for the most recent patch .
nope , there are no penalties for losing . ( a couple of reviews seem to confirm this ) i seem to remember there being a boss fight or two where you had be heckled , but otherwise you can lose as often as you want . the game 's aimed at a younger audience , and it is fairly casual on the whole , so there not being any penalties for losing a battle is not that unusual .
tactics will vary depending on your army composition , and that of the enemy . i will mostly be talking about pve , as that is my strong point , having played only a few field battles in the multiplayer portion of the game . iirc , in pvp you only get 40% of the attacker 's army size for balance purposes : it is obviously very advantageous to defend . luckily , the ai can be beat with an equal-sized army on a regular basis , and with even less sometimes . i always run a purely ashigaru force on legendary , rarely bringing cannons " for the lulz " , and almost never using matchlocks in my army composition . hence , my advice on exotic stuff is limited : siege weapons seem mostly useless , forcing you to take on a repair bill as well as a public order decrease , having damage that is mostly inferior to a normal ranged unit with the only benefit being range , and iirc slowing your army down . guns are great as a defender and useless as an attacker . stealth looks neat , but is mostly pointless . bows are pointless in a siege , especially as the attacker , if you can not get a full quiver 's mileage out of them - they just can not do the damage of their melee counterparts if you only get five or six volleys in , and they cost more . if , for any reason , you can not get ten minutes of continuous arrow fire to use up all your ammo , if you have to make a charge for the walls under enemy fire , use you bows as cannon fodder . move them in range of the enemy archers before your melee units , preferably in a scattered formation and as a very wide , shallow line . the same should be done if you have to scale the walls under fire and have already used up your bows ' ammo ( great job ! ) . they do not necessarily have to just stand there either : you can use them to scale the walls first , often on the side opposite to your melee units , sacrificing them in droves to force enemy units off your main approach route . this will often get enemy archers to leave the walls , turn around , and shoot at your diversion , making the main wave 's push 100% safe . on the very rare case where they do not , you can still engage them yourself . still , scaling walls bow-first is a bloody endeavor , and should be avoided unless you really know your stuff - it is a very good way to waste five to ten units for a marginal benefit that was not necessary . burning down the gate and charging in a clumped mass of 600 bodies should give your diversion a ton of staying power , but for the most part , keep to just using scattered lines to absorb enemy fire . now , i advised using up all your arrows . how do you do that , you ask ? flanking . unless you are fighting a 20v20 siege with a good amount of archers thrown in , your enemy will have an unguarded portion of the wall . the ai tends to stack archers against your melee units and your general : positioning your archers on the opposite side of the fort , or on the flanks , will usually get them facing unguarded sections . as long as you keep your melee units in place , the enemy bows will obligingly stand and watch in the only direction they can not fire in , waiting for those 500 yaris that are just outside arrow range ( or 1km away , it does not seem to matter ) to close in , as you gleefully slaughter their comrades . if any towers are shooting at your archers , you can burn them down by using melee mode , which gets your archers to chuck torches at them just like a melee unit : you do not need to have fire arrows researched , and even if you do , save the ability to boost damage and do not waste it on structures . in this screenshot , four bows are facing the three yari on the opposite side of the fort , offscreen , and two are facing the direction my own bows and the general came from initially . they never moved from there and were later killed in melee . my own bows are not at max squad size due to previous battles ; very few were killed as they approached through the forest ( which acts as heavy cover against arrows ) , and not a single arrow was fired at them after they got in position . what units to target : generally , focus on melee units first , cavalry second ( unless you are using a ton of katanas and no spears ) , and do not even bother with archers , even if they are out of cover . get squads down to 20%-40% of their maximum size and move on to another : shooting at a unit of 20 soldiers is a waste of ammo . shoot on units that will not change their direction until the arrows land : your archers will lead the enemy , but they do not do any advance prediction , and always assume that the target will keep its speed and heading for the projectile 's entire flight . . . even if there is a castle wall a meter ahead . shoot either at units standing still , or at units moving in a straight line that are unlikely to stop or turn soon . disable manual fire . for best effect , shoot at the flanks or rear of enemy formations . target deep formations relative to your shooting direction : this way , even arrows that miss have a good chance of hitting the troops behind . sneak in as many generals as you can in your group of archers : sometimes , they will get enemy archers to reposition , in which case you should return them to your melee units . when this does not happen , the inspires they provide are great for boosting arrow efficiency , while stand and fight makes everything better . if the enemy does have enough bows to cover the entire wall , do not panic . it is fully possible to burn down a gate and sacrifice a single yari ashigaru per bow ashigaru troop ( if you are less confident in yourself , go for three units for two troops ) to make an opening . they will be swarmed and die , but provided you time it reasonably well , they will destroy all but a dozen of a previously full squad . against samurai and above , you are probably out of luck : unlike ashigaru , they can survive reasonably well in melee , even against expensiver units . still , except for kyoto , most sieges do not involve a 100% samurai defense . if enemy bows move in to intercept your flanking force , peel off a squad and abuse another opening , gradually adding more until all enemy archers are stuck waiting for a single bow unit ( preferably depleted ) to come in range , in a situation analogous to those camping the meleers . do not tire your men . the main ( only , even ) reason the ai can not to reliably win sieges with twice the defenders ' force is because it can not stop running . running is not needed in a siege : even the 10-meter deadzone before under the walls can be walked through , although saving energy from that is needlessly risky . once your melee units have scaled the wall , they are every bit as capable as the enemy , only handicap being the amount of fatigue they have accumulated from the climb : hence , keep to scaling short sections if you can help it . scaling is best done from every direction , to flank the enemy : while morale does not matter , a troop in the rear inflicts many more kills , decreasing your own attrition . for the melee phase of the battle , do not forget to use your depleted archers : having 1200 men stand around is a huge waste . the most basic thing they can be tasked with is capturing the fort control zone : a mass of even cheap units can easily crowd the place and make it unreachable to enemies unless they can cut at a heroic pace . the only problem is getting there in the first place , easily solved by scaling second , as a flanking force , from multiple directions . archers can also be used to tie down enemy bows or charge flanks . be bold when using them and prepare to take huge losses with little gains : soon , you will learn what works and what does not . scaling the walls is generally for when you are wiping the enemy out , burning the gates down is for when the battle is not going your way . when scaling , the enemy should only have a third to a tenth of their original melee force left ( and who cares about archers , they suck at melee and invariably get forced into it within the first fifteen seconds of the charge ) , allowing you to swarm and massacre . if there are a lot of enemies left , presumably because you failed to empty your quivers or because you attacked with a much smaller force ( good job , but why are you reading this then ? ) , i will describe a moderately advanced trick i try every once in a while that may work for you . burn down a gate and make a deep yari wall formation in guard mode get inside , but do not expose their flanks : there is a castle model where some of the gates have inner walls , allowing the entire formation to get in while only exposing the front . for most , you just have to support them from the side or barely get inside . a yari wall has great staying power , especially if you manage to get enemy yari to attack it first , as opposed to katana units . if all goes well , soon the entire garrison will be swarming your diversion : they can easily hold out if the flank is safe . if not all units are engaged , burn down a second gate and approach with a similar formation , tying up the rest . then , scale from a third direction using a squad with big unit size , or even several , massing the fort capture point : put a wall of bodies in front of the area , making sure that the enemy can not kill enough in a minute to get to the location . your bow squads are perfect for this . usually , only one or two squads will break off to meet you , letting you capture the point with little losses against what could have been unwinnable odds . random bit of info : an unupgraded , unleveled unit of bow ashigaru without access to inspire has just enough ammo to kill the free samurai retainer unit . ps : army composition : the more archers you have , the harder it is to utilize them properly . 16 melee 3 archers is reliable but unremarkable . 16 archers 3 melee is hard to pull off , and is still reliable ( this time , in bringing even the best players some embarrassing losses ) , but can net you amazing kill:death ratios against superior forces . stay in the 7:12 - 12:7 range for a good mix of reliability and efficiency .
this is not a trivial task and it depends on the lane opponent as well as the role . the only definitive answer is experience . as an example for an ad carry you have to look at the base stats , calculate the potential damage and burst as well as the survivability for each level and compare it to other ad carrys . however , this still gives wrong information since for example caitlyn with relatively weak burst still has an extremely strong laning phase against many ad carrys due to her huge range . as a few rules of thumb : champions with good area of effect skills are stronger lategame than earlygame since they are more effective in teamfights when they can actually hit multiple targets ( ex . : anivia , graves ) single target burst champions ( assassins ) are weak early on , strong in the midgame and fall off lategame when their damage is no longer enough to instantly kill someone ( ex . : leblanc , kassadin ) champions with a strong long range skill ( poking skill ) are very useful lategame to soften up opponents prior to engagements but are usually weaker in the laning phase ( ex . : kog'maw ) tanks have a weak early laning phase due to their low damage but become very strong lategame due to their influence on teamfights ( ex . : malphite ) champions with crowd control effects ( stuns , snares , blinds , knock ups , knock backs , . . . ) are strong all game long ( ex . : alistar ) mobile champions are strong midgame where they can roam but their mobility often comes at the cost of sustained dps , making them less effective in teamfights ( ex . : ezreal ) skill shot based champions are weak in the laning phase but stronger in lategame/teamfights where it is harder to dodge the skill shots note that all those rules depend on the actual champion , the opponents , the team composition , the player skill , etc . as an example i wrote above that ezreal is less effective in teamfights , which is true only if both teams protect ( i.e. . peel ) for the ad carry , which is often not the case in &lt ; 1200 elo teams . if the teams do not peel , the good mobility of ezreal will be more important than the sustained damage output , giving him an edge in teamfights compared to a stronger , less mobile ad carry .
if you made those chunks ( new world or explored new area ) during 1.6 , clay was bugged and only occurred when the x coordinate equaled the z coordinate . new chunks in 1.7 should be unaffected by this bug , so you can explore further in an existing map , causing more chunks to be generated , or start a new world . in the future , i think the amount of clay was going to be upped , as notch felt it rarer than desired .
hillmen can be found in : agamaur ( lone-lands ) garth agarwen ( lone-lands ) east of estedlin ( north downs ) fassach-falroid ( angmar ) south trollshaws ( trollshaws ) evendim -- these are around level 36 , and are called gauredain . they can be found all over hillmen are also found in forochel , dunland , and eregion . you can see this page for information about the various hill-men in lotro . also , see if you can find a group who is also grinding hill-men , it will make things a lot faster !
like with all insect-like critters , his weak spot is the massive hindbody . you will need to either aim past his armored front or maneuver around him .
if all of these characters are on the same battle .netaccount , ( ie , you are using a single diablo 3 cd key/login ) you can do this by putting the dagger in your stash - the stash is shared across all characters on the same account . the stash is a treasure chest-like object that is usually near the town waypoint in whatever act you are currently in . it is represented by a " treasure chest " icon on your minimap . however , hardcore characters cannot access items stashed in your " normal " stash , and vice versa . that is covered here : hardcore vs standard shared stash limitations there is an intentional wall between hardcore characters and " normal " characters - therefore , there is no way to trade between them . if they are on different accounts , ( ie , you have to log out and log back in with a different account to switch between characters ) your best bet is to get both characters into the same game and use the trade interface , or just drop the item on the ground and have the other character pick it up . again , since hardcore and " normal " characters can not be in the same game , you can not do this between a hardcore and " normal " character even if they are on different accounts .
twitch archiving is not suppose to be working yet . this feature is not yet implemented but planned ( eurogamer ) . though several users report that some streams seems to be archived .
i do not believe there is , at least not in the base game . i have never seen one referenced in-game . i checked the manual ( page 207 , click the link " keyboard shortcuts " from the table of contents ) as well as a couple of third-party sites . i found this " light touch " mod which gives you a bit more control over worker automation . it is not exactly what you are looking for , but it might take some of the frustration out of worker automation .
the saved game cannot be resumed because there are ' hooks ' in the code which trigger the game to discontinue . i used to work for sports interactive so the only possible way for this demo saved game to be continued is for a senior coder to have it converted into a full game save or have the hooks removed . even then , you will probably find that the database on your demo is too old a version and a new error will spawn .
if a steam game supports steam cloud , savegames are automatically synced with steam servers and are available on other computers if you log in with your steam account . it does not necessarily store all your savegames , e.g. with civilization v you have 10 savegame slots on steam cloud , so when you save a game you have to choose to save there , else the savegame will only be local . you can use this search to find a list of steam cloud games . for games that do not support this you could try synchronization with online storage providers like dropbox , i never tried this myself but it should be possible . most games have their savegame data somewhere in you personal home directory , often inside the " my games " folder .
i have created an excel file matching data from wikia and lol builder android app . when i will finish all cross-checks maybe i will post the file in some online repository ; in the meanwhile here it is the list of champions ordered by auto attack range : all other champions have a range of 200 or less .
as of update 1.3 , you can now tell who will be next to unlock by looking in the store or the album . the price of the next bitizen to unlock will drop to 1 bux in both places . if the next to unlock has an associated ? character , then you will see them in the store . and , the order they appear from the top is the order of unlocking . this appears to have fixed a bug present in previous versions where this was not working properly .

i found a forum thread that suggests that you can do this : use the hdmi xbox cable to carry the picture through an hdmi-to-dvi converter , and then use the other xbox cable to carry sound ( red and white wires ) . however you may need to remove part of the connector base of one of the xbox cables so that both will fit in the xbox at the same time ; apparently the 2 cables may not fit together at the same time . here is another thread discussing a similar idea . to research this , i googled " hdmi to dvi adapter sound "
as you noted , you can buy a backpack to add 10 storage to your inventory . backpacks are available from merchants in several of the major towns . sterno and other users confirm that they do stack . purchasing one from gorhart takes you to 80 and buying the one in ysa bring you to 90 , and so on . the following vendors sell backpacks : rikka egest ( at the corner shop in gorhart ) riona helt ( at asker 's alley in ysa ) wil donall ( at main hall of scholia arcana in rathir ) senecer macit ( at domus politica in adessa ) illyn doldran ( in mel senshir ) ampelio ( at idylla market in idylla , in the teeth of narros dlc ) since backpacks do not show as inventory items , you can not use them to increase your stash , unfortunately .
it is currently just those four divisions , in the order you specified .
from my understanding of mtgt you have to have an internet connection to log in , and you must maintain this connection or you will be kicked off .
what is a good strategy for quickly leveling perks that gain experience through damage ? the perks i am talking about are support specialist , berserker , firebug , and demolitions . do not play single-player please . it is not very fun , and you will not learn from other people . most of these tips to follow , i have gained through watching other people play . the best advice i can give you is to find out what your perk specializes in and do that . do not do things your perk is not great at : ) support specialist weld doors if your team holes up somewhere . aim for the head . shotguns penetrate through several enemies much easier if you aim for the head instead of the chest . crouch when you see crawlers ( everyone hates those nasty little turds ) do not buy armor/grenades/pistol ammo for the first 4-5 waves in order to save up for an aa12 . this is good advice for other classes too . berserker if your team holes up somewhere , you should be at the front , soaking in the damage . everything should attack you first . you should get a decent medic ( get a mic and use it , it makes life much easier ) you can stun certain enemies , especially scrakes . this is important -- read up on kf-wiki . com how to do it . learn to know when you are getting screwed . you move fast as a zerker so you can run away -- just be sure to run away before being really screwed : ) firebug religiously leave " big " things like scrakes and fleshpounds to other perks . just run away : ) watch when your friendlies are getting screwed and unload your whole canister into them . demolition players especially will love you if you help them out when they are screwed and overran by small things . do not annoy your team with flames -- it really makes it hard to aim and it blurs everyone 's vision . stand away from friendlies ( pick an " entrance " to your camping spot and cover it on your own , or use the mac10 ) you make a ton of money as firebug -- spread the love . no use dying rich : ) demolition this one is tough -- leave it for later if you can . it is expensive and somewhat hard to play . always stay behind friendlies -- you have very little " close quarter " killing abilities . it is best if your team camps in a spot . stand on top of a car or gain elevation in any way , and then shoot for clumps of small things . use the m79 ( single-shot ) as primary , and leave m32 for when your team faces a scrake/fleshpound . general advice : ) use a microphone , even if just for yelling out " scrake " or " fleshpound " or " need help please " ask for how much money you need , not that you need money . you are way more likely to get money if you say how much you want . stick to your team : ) look for weapons to sell -- most of your " advanced " weapons cost a lot of money , so save like a scrooge . learn how to kite a lot of enemies -- if you are screwed , cut your way out , and run like a . . female canine . then , let them follow you , and pick ' em off one by one . look at how other people are using a perk . most of the advice above is from seeing what other people do and doing it myself . i have got most classes to 5 or 6 , so i have picked up a bunch of tricks from people . enjoy yourself ! do not worry too much about playing on other difficulties , you will get there eventually . have fun with where you are .
there is no drop bias for sets . the only variables are magic find and item level ( and obviously some monsters / bosses have a higher magic item drop rate ) .
your theory on how this works is correct . i tested out my weapons that " conveyed x damage over y seconds " by hitting a monster and then backing up and watching their health bar . the health bar went down without me touching the monster , and since i had not burned , froze , poisoned , or otherwise cast a spell to bring the monster 's health down , i concluded that the " convey x damage . . . " deals that amount of damage over time to the monster .
i am not sure what the first game to do this was , but a " tell " is a private message sent to another player . i think it originates way back from text-based muds where to message someone you had type something like tell &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt; . these days many multiplayer games call those messages " whispers " instead , but often /tell will be aliased to it . for example , in world of warcraft you can message someone either via /w for " whisper " or /t for " tell " . so , " please send tell " basically means " contact me privately to respond " .
yes , that is precisely what it means - a mule can mine a mineral patch which is already being mined by 3 scvs ( which is the maximum number of scvs on a single patch ) . consequently , mules can increase the mineral income even for expansions already completely saturated ( 24 scvs on minerals ) . two mules can not mine from the same patch , by the way .
the sc2 ai will scout and it will respond to what you do during the specific game in question , but the knowledge does not carry over into different play sessions . the closest thing the ai does to " learning " on normal maps is what happens when you play on insane difficulty . in this mode , the ai is known to cheat in two ways : it gets more minerals per worker trip than normal it always knows where your units are and can create counters to your units as you are building them regarding left 2 die , the more difficult settings do not learn between play-throughs . if you employ the same strategy in one session on brutal , it will get you just as far in another play session as well .
the point of a charge station is that a turtle can be self-refueling . this is useful for self-contained turtle " machines " . for example , if you have a turtle minding a tree farm , it can sit comfortably in its charge station while in its wait loop , and be fully charged when it gets to its " go around the farm and check the trees " code section . if its code is not buggy and the charge station 's power supply is reliable , it could happily run indefinitely without manual refueling . of course , there are not very many obvious uses for unmonitored turtles , since there are so many other ways of automating processes in ftb . if you have a " pet " turtle that you carry around with you and only set down for specific tasks while you are nearby , then yes , manual fueling makes much more sense .
it is complicated for a number of reasons , but here 's some things i learned from fiddling in excel . for starters , dodge will mitigate 100% of any hits you dodge , but you will only dodge d% of the time . armor will mitigate a% of every hit , but that value is dependent on the level of the enemies attacking you ( see this question ) . so the basic question is " what has to be true for d to be greater than a ? " at level 60 , my calculations show that 520 armor will give you just over 15% damage reduction from armor . so you only need 520 dexterity for sieze the initiative to start being better . however , this is only true if you have 0 base armor and 0 base dodge , which is probably not true ! if you have 100 armor you only need 420 dexterity - unless you have 5% base dodge , in which case you will need 700 dexterity on top of your 100 armor . . . you can use this table to estimate how much mitigation you will get from armor when fighting level 60 monsters : if you look up your base armor + dexterity here and compare to your base dodge + 15% you should be able to tell which is better in a given situation . overall it seems like it is pretty easy to stack dexterity and have sieze the initiative outperform the guardian 's path , but i tend to stack dex anyway and definitely have not attempted to stack dodge , so i am not sure which is more viable in the long run .
you will get if after 3 the stages of the movement tutorial : run to him by holding ctrl do a long jump by holding &larr ; or &rarr ; in combination with &uarr ; do an long jump attack , which is similar to a long jump , but instead of holding &uarr ; just tap it . note that you can talk by pressing enter while facing someone .
unfortunately , it does seem that some update between 1.4.7 and now has broken this particular aspect of the design . but it is a rather simple fix if you want to continue with this particular pez dispenser design ( referred in the video as a " cart hopper" ) . you just need to send the cart forward above the hole where your cart hopper is . the simplest way to do this is like this , with a powered rail pointed towards your cart hopper . you can extend this rail however you like ( you can even connect it to the arrivals line , and have it sent back to the cart hopper when you get out of the cart using a pressure plate ) . however , some of the recent updates have given redstoners some interesting options with minecart dispensers ; the old pez dispenser design is no longer necessary . one of my personal favorite designs these days that combines cart launcher and cart retriever is this one : when you push the button , the dispenser dispenses a cart , and launches it ( be quick to catch it , or you can use a powered rail and a tripwire down the line to have it wait for you ) . when you come back , break the cart , and the hopper will pick it up and put it back in the dispenser . you can hook this bad boy up to whatever track switching mechanism you plan to use , and you are set .
as suggested in this post , there currently seems to be a bug when killing several monsters of the same pack at the same time . what happens is that the last two monsters of the champion pack dies at the exact same time , triggering the nephalem valor stack ' gain ' twice . the above post seems to point that killing more monsters of an champion pack could give you more stacks of the buff . note that this can only happen on champion packs , not rare mobs , as only champion packs allow different monsters to trigger the nephalem valor ' gain ' . even if the post has no answers from blizzard , i guess this will be considered as a bug and fixed somewhere in the future . edit : the bug has been fixed with a hotfix on july , 3rd 2012 .
i know this is an old question , but since i have not seen a definition of what happens here it goes . basically being a thane means that the guards will clear a bounty of up to 3000 gold once per hold . it does not matter which guard sees you or how many crimes you have committed , so long as your bounty is less than 3000 you can have it cleared by declaring thaneship when the guard attempts to arrest you . once you have used this privilege you will need to start paying the bounty just like everybody else . see uesp article on bounty - declaring thaneship .
jigglypuff is a quite unconventional character , that is true - but whether a character is good or not is very subjective , so it is very hard to give a proper answer to this . i will try my best , though . when one has gotten used to playing as jigglypuff , she can be quite a formidable fighter . almost all of jigglypuff 's b moves are very tactical , and take a while to learn . they do , however , work very well in conjunction . b + up : sing . sing takes a good while to execute , but when in close quarters without much danger of projectile attacks , this is a great move to use as it will put opponents to sleep . while they are sleeping , you often have plenty of time to inflict damage or try to smash them away . b : rollout . rollout is a great move to start charging while the action is going on elsewhere , since a successful rollout hit can do a whole lot . without charging , it can be used for horizontal movement , but is not much of an attack . b + side : pound . pound is , to be completely honest , not very useful , though it can be used to move fast and far horizontally in the air , if used repeatedly . b + down : rest . rest is , without a doubt , jigglypuff 's most powerful move . it will put jigglypuff to sleep for a good while , so make sure you are in a good situation when using it . if jigglypuff is right inside ( or at least touching ) an opponent while initiating rest , it will smash the foe with incredible force . just make sure your target has a high damage percentage when using it , and that not too many others are close by ! if used together with sing , it can often be easier to hit with . together with these , you can always use the quick direction + a combo ( or the c-stick on a gamecube controller ) to inflict some nice damage and possibly knock your foes a good bit away , and of course do not be afraid of going for a few grabs every now and then - jigglypuff 's grab + down can often work out quite well . jigglypuff 's final smash takes some getting used to - it is probably most effective if your opponents are close to an edge .
as you can see the team on the right side is " slightly favored . " favoring is usually a good indicator of how many ladder points you will win : opponent favored : 20-25 opponent slightly favored : 15-25 even : 10-15 you slightly favored : 5-10 you favored : 1-5 bare in mind these are rough estimates . in theory favoring is based on your hidden rank . however , since the points you are awarded are based on your visible rank , it is possible for both sides to be favored . this did occur during the beta , but has reportedly been " cleaned up . "
i can say 100% that yes , you can . the only restriction is that you must have your pokedex . i have tried this , and can confirm . i know the pokedex thing because i attempted to access the bank with a different game in , and that is specifically what bridget says . on top of that , the bank is only tied to your nintendo id . i have traded between three different games with the bank already , two ys and an x . so that is 100% possible , as well . keep in mind you can not use this to transfer items . if your pokemon is holding an item , it will be sent back to your bag , and if the bag is full it will be deleted instead .
it seems that some enemies are tied to some missions , while others will appear anyway , but it seems that if you are quick enough they will appear earlier after certain missions . credit to yx and sterno in the comments below ! enemies which are tied to missions outsiders - first appear in a downed ufo . one appears in most ( but not all ) ufos after that . sectoid commanders - first appears during the assault on the alien base . after this point , sectoid commanders appear on the bridge of alien ufos , replacing the outsider . after the overseer ship mission is complete , they are replaced by ethereals . sectoid commanders may also appear on harder alien abduction missions , usually in small groups . source ethereals - first appear in the assault purple ufo mission , and then randomly in missions afterwards enemies which will appear anyway sectoids floaters and heavy floaters mutons and elite mutons berserkers sectopods thin men spartacus mentioned that chrysalids may be tied to the first terror mission .
let 's take a look at what you can do : best solution : get a eul 's scepter ! as soon as borrowed time is triggered , eul 's him and he wont be able to regenerate thus using his ult for nothing . many abaddon will go in the melee thinking they are " unkillable " , this will make them think twice before doing it again . you can obtain the same result with astral emprisonment ( outworld devourer ) , disruption ( shadow demon ) , nightmare ( bane ) , song of the siren ( naga ) , tornado ( invoker ) and wind brewling 's cyclone ( brewmaster ) axe 's culing blade overpass borrowed time . borrowed time triggers at 400 or less hp while aganim 's scepter and culling blade at level 11 insta-kill a target below 450hp ( small margin ) and 625hp at level 16 ( better margin ) . give that abaddon some taste of axe 's axe abaddon is reliant on mana to cast apotic shield : diffusal blade on your carry or any mana burning spell will help you . abaddon as a melee carry does not have a great disable ( such as void or alchemist ) or a great chasing potential ( such as magina , phantom lancer or mortred ) so slowing him and kiting him in a teamfight is really easy . get a support with a powerfull slow ( tuskar , venomancer , crystal maiden etc . ) or do it with an item ( rod of atos , skadi ) . abaddon is not that great of a damage dealer , if he uses a bkb to prevent slow : just kite him or back a little then fight once he is no longer magic immune .
i saw 4 pirate caves in the nexus the other day , so i conclude that yes , it is possible to use a dungeon key in the nexus .
cars cannot be sold in the single player game . i have tried selling at ls custom , but there is no option for it .
i am going to quote from the uesp : there are many ways to contract the disease , all of them involve encountering hostile vampires and letting them attack you . however , rather than let them hit you in melee , you should keep your distance and only allow them to cast their draining spell as this is the only attack that can impart the disease . to speed up contraction , repeatedly lose and gain sight of the target vampire so the spell is cast multiple times . the check for giving you the disease is passed only when the draining spell hits you , not over sustained action . so the trick is to fight vampires and force them to use their vampiric drain spell on you . exploit line of sight for maximum casts .
before completing the game , you can only change skins in the challenge rooms , after completing the game you have the chance to pick your batman skin before loading your normal game or new game plus . edit : you can change skins before completing the game by entering this cheat code , i do not know if disables achievements/trophies or not , though press the following combination on the main menu screen ( after you have selected your save slot ) : left , left , down , down , left , left , right , up , up , down
i knew some picture existed , the win rate versus ping . it is 6 months old and there are 3403014 games used for the statistics , so it is a fairly good representative . 1 and 2 of your questions are opinion based , so i will not answer them here ( but you can draw conclusions from the picture . for example a ping > 100ms is bad ) . 3 however is a different story . you see that a ping lower then 50 ms results ( well , you have to do it yourself of course ) in a > 50% win rate , which i call an advantage . so maybe you can say that 50ms is the threshold , and everything above that does not grant an advantage . source of the picture , for completeness and shizzle .
blue dots indicate mythical items . similarly , pink/fuschia items are transcendent .
i used to level pickpocket , sneak and speech at the same by trying to steal from guards . just sneak behind them for a bit , then pickpocket an easy item and repeat until you get caught . now just opt to persuade them . once your spech is high enough to persuade , you will be able to do this exactly once for each guard . they will however remember you and arrest you when you try to steal again from that exact guard . also if you are heavily into pickpocket , i would recommend a mod to increase the maximum chance to 100% . in vanilla state , skyrim caps the maxium chance at 95% , which will leave you getting into problems regularly even as a pickpocketing master . there are plenty mods available to achieve this , i would recommend this one as it does just that and nothing else .
quest xp is not all that awesome compared to killing monsters , honestly . you can kill many monsters in the time it takes to complete one quest stage , and the rewards for quests are considerably less than those for monsters . as far as regions go , i would suggest just clearing everything and moving on asap - generally the content is balanced so that you are gaining levels at around the rate you are clearing areas . generally the next place you should go to advance the plot is the best place for your character to be gaining levels . if you have already made pretty good progress on at least one character , chances are you are sitting on a pile of gold . you can use this gold and the auction house in a couple of beneficial ways : buy rare items ! not just ones with bonus xp , but look for rares that are around your level for all your slots . being able to one-shot enemies due to powerful rare equipment makes killing ( and therefore leveling ) much quicker . if you can find some steals at the auction house , you can be crazy , stupid overpowered for the area you are in . class specific rares in particular are generally super cheap ! buy socketed helmets and a good ruby ! as was noted in this question , there is no level limit for using gems , and it is almost intended that you will use gems to level up new characters . a square ruby , for instance , can be socketed into a helmet for a 17% experience boost , and set me back about 10k gold at the auction house . 17% more xp is generally going to do more for you in the long run than ~10-20 xp per kill , especially in act 2 and beyond . if you can find a rare socketed helmet with +xp per kill , and you add a good quality ruby , you will be gaining xp like crazy . the ruby 's recyclable , so you can invest in the best quality one you can find and just keep changing the helmet it is in depending on your level or the character you are currently playing . each upgrade in gem quality adds 2% to the xp bonus , so keep that in mind when shopping . the price will change over time , so which is the " best " to buy is going to vary depending on market conditions . look for price breaks - 10k gold for a 6% improvement might make sense , but another 10k to gain 2% probably does not . of course , if you are sitting on a pile of gold and your time 's worth more than draining your bank account , your economics might be different .
means that the achievement has 6 rewards for completeing its various stages . is the collapsed/expanded state of the achievement . if this icon is absent , the achievement cannot be expanded . means that this achievement is worth 10 points . achievement " points " are an arbitrary number by which you can measure your awesomeness . nearly all achievements are worth 10 points , regardless of their difficulty . the one notable exception to this rule is " meta-achievements " , the criteria for which are to complete a group of other achievements that are typically related to one another . these are usually worth more than 10 points .
nothing is impossible when you install a mod . mods are called mods because they literally modify ( or augment ) the binaries of minecraft . they are not plugins or addons or extensions , since minecraft has no api for these sorts of things . therefore , any mod you install can do anything minecraft has permission to . this includes accessing the internet , any of your documents and saves , etc . this is why it is vitally important only to install mods you trust , just as you would any other program you obtain from the internet . while it is unlikely that an improperly installed mod would do anything to other worlds , a broken ( and poorly written ) mod may attempt to modify your other saves ( or any other files on your computer ) and a malicious mod could destroy all of your saves and everything else on your computer . use caution , back up saves , and only install working mods from places you trust .
citadel - hanar diplomat - personal experience if kasumi dies in the suicide mission , then starting the " hanar diplomat " quest will mention that the information was received from her prior to her death , at which point you are given speech options to optionally talk about how wonderful she was . other than that , nobody else takes part in the mission in her stead , you just have to go it alone . grissom academy - emergency evacuation - wiki it looks lke if jack did not make it , she is replaced by ensign jason prangley : after the battle , the students will say that their co was killed , leaving ensign jason prangley in charge . if jack survived the events of mass effect 2 , she will appear instead and berate shepard for his involvement with cerberus in mass effect 2 . this seems to heave a few additional effects for the mission and decision on how to use the students after the mission is completed : if jack is not present , a student will ask if you ever forget the first time you kill someone , giving you extra paragon or renegade points . at the end of the mission : if it is jack , everyone gets out . if it is prangley , he is shot and killed just before he makes it . this does not seem to prevent the choice of what to do with them , just might persuade you to rethink it : once inside the shuttle , kahlee sanders will request that shepard rethink having the students play a military role , especially if jack is not around and their their instructor and their student leader are both dead . attican traverse - krogan team - personal experience and wiki as mentioned in ' s answer , grunt is replaced by urdnot dagg if he died in mass effect 2 . functionally the quest is the same either way , with no change to the end of the quest where : grunt/dagg will sacrifice himself so that that you can make it to your shuttle no matter which choice you make . however , if you have grunt and completed his loyalty mission in mass effect 2 , then there is a slight difference : [ grunt ] will survive the heroic sacrifice and return as a war asset ( 25 ) .
there is no way of finding out all of the information for the covenants in-game . some things are hinted , others you will find through trial and error . for in-depth information regarding covenants i advice you to check one of the several dark souls wikis , such as these : dark souls wikidot , dark souls wikispaces or dark souls ign wiki guide . there are nine covenants in the game . as a general rule , joining a covenant and following it is rules provides you with one or several rewards . sometimes , there is also a penalty for betraying a covenant ( killing a npc aligned with such covenant or joining a different one ) . some covenants allow you to rank up your alignment by offering a particular item , in order to get additional rewards . here 's some info i gathered from my first play-through and some info digging .

unfortunately , this is an annoying part of the game . the only real ' trick ' is to make sure you stand directly over the point where the animal is glowing , and you see the prompt on the screen to skin . same thing goes for the looting . though , this is a much more annoying issue . the person drops the gun right next to him . you need to make sure that the game is not prompting you to pick up a gun , but to loot the body . the two points are so close , that you can jiggle between the two . it takes practice , but i have gotten very good at this .
from good list of way to train all your skills on reddit conjuration buy the bound sword find slaughterfish stand at the edge of water so slaughterfish can not attack you , and so that you will still be in combat cast bound sword ( do not dual sword it ) , sheath your weapon and repeat . you can get the apprentice conjuration magic perk to make this process go by faster . this process is so quick you can have 100 conjuration in little over 1 and a half hour . or repeatedly cast soul trap on any dead creature .
it seems your second character , in your case roderick , picks always the same until the left character wins one time . then the right character shifts one to the left . when the left character starts with paper and the right one with the scissors , the right one will choose the scissors as long as you choose paper . this way the right char wins the argument . if you switch to stone and thus beat the scissors , the right char will move one symbol to the left . so his choice will be paper the next time . you can now choose the scissors and beat him again . also he will again move one symbol to the left and choose stone . so you can " go in circles " and win the argument with the left character .
short answer : no . exp gems are only used for desynthing . i have played the game through twice and never found any recipes that invole these gems . holding on to them to use the gems later does not do anything either , as their amount will always be absolute and not scale to your level .
i tested this a few days ago with a friend , because i was also curious . here 's what i found out : when a player is displayed as a " flag icon " instead of a dot icon it means they are currently on the world map or in the menu . when you go near a player when they have said " flag icon " it will also say " paused " next to their name . all in all , it indicates to other players that you are an easy target .
before 2.0.1 . the problem with item drops was that some items would get all combat useful stats like damage , health , crit , etc . making them a much better choice than some items that would get just support things like move speed , pickup radius , gold find , etc . items that got half of both should have been ideal for game but were still underpowered compared to those with all combat useful stats . to fix this blizzard decided to split item stats in 2 groups ( primary and secondary ) and divide them in 4:2 or 3:3 ratio on all items , so now every item will contribute something to your combat power and will have some support skills . primary group combat useful stats like : core attributes , armor , critical chance and damage , health regen , splash damage , etc . secondary group support stats that help you in other ways like : movement speed , pickup radius , single resist , resource gain , experience gain , magic find , etc . longer list here . when you compare 2 items the game will calculate difference between your damage , toughness and healing that would occur if you equip the targeted item . orange diamond next to some stats means that those stats are not included in the comparison calculation ( they do not affect your damage , toughness or healing ) , and you will have to decide for yourself if they are worth changing the item .
an unexpected event sometimes attributed to a divine entity should lead you to the correct answer .
you will only have access to what is on the disk . if the previous owner has purchased any dlc then it will only be available on his/her account . everything that has been purchased from the playstation store will only be available on the account which has been used to purchase it . an example : i have Mortal Kombat with some dlcs for it . if i will lend/sell my disk to anyone , he will only have basic Mortal Kombat , no dlcs . but Mortal Kombat requires a key to play online . if i already activated that key , nobody else will be able to use it , so they will have to purchase the key online .
you need to fall into that cage from the 4th floor . the pit that is directly between the 4 scrolls ( which usually has a teleportation field active directly on it ) is the one that you need to fall down . to be able to fall into this pit , you need to deactivate the teleportation field . there is a button ( marked a on the map below ) in a hallway outside of the scroll room which will temporarily raise two pit covers ( circled on the map ) in the scroll room . you then have to run across those before they collapse again and press a hidden switch on the wall ( marked b on the map ) , which temporarily deactivates the teleportation field . you then have to run quickly to the center pit ( marked c on the map ) before the field reactivates . the timing on this is pretty tight , and there is not much of a margin for wasted movement . credit to gamebanshee for the level map
compasses still point to the spawn point . even with the /sethome plugins or if you have slept in a bed , it will remain pointing to the default spawn point .

the specific details about the scripting language have not been announced , but they are not using the same scripting language as oblivion , and have built a completely new language for skyrim ( more on scripting in skyrim ) . supposedly the language is more extensive than the previous one and may be feature complete enough to not require extenders , but that remains to be seen once it has been officially released . the results from the skyrim script extender project indicate that the old scripting language is still there ( see : full command list , including references to vats and the pipboy ) , but also that there is a second , vm-based scripting language called " papyrus " included . to quote ianpatt from the skyrim mod forums : time to start turning this in to the " skyrim internal technical research discussion " thread . this time around , it looks like we have two totally different scripting engines in the game . one is the classic system used in the previous games , it looks almost exactly the same from a very quick lookthrough . command dump coming shortlyish . the new one is much more interesting and appears to be called papyrus or skyrimvm . we will probably need to wait for the editor to be released to get any idea about the syntax as the original source code for scripts does not appear to be in the . esm ( unless they are compressed ) . however , here 's a quick feature rundown from what i can tell . please take things with a grain of salt for now , this is just a first look . core variable types are float , int , string , and bool arrays of the above are supported natively scripts are interpreted as a list of simpler yet much more powerful set of opcodes if the conditional branch opcodes support negative offsets then loops are trivial to implement ( and probably have been ) the new system is object-oriented - all scripts are class instances ( unrealscript influence here ) compiled scripts are stored as separate files , unpack misc . bsa and look in the scripts folder classes support inheritance , and there appear to be vm-world classes matching the internal form types
they typically indicate the " level " of the power-up . more accurately though , they actually indicate the quantity of that power up . for example , if you enter a level 2 power up , you will find that once inside , you ( as the power-up ) contain 2 copies of that individual power-up . you can also have additional ones since you can have a total of three , but the number displayed is always of the highest number of a single power-up . so a power up that contains 2 big shots , and 1 spread , will be represented as an icon of big shot with a number 2 . using this system you can go into power-ups and attempt to " upgrade " them by increasing the number of individual power-ups that are contained with ( and contained within those , ad infinitum ) . for instance , if you want more health , simply find a health power up , enter it , and then find more health power-ups once inside . once you find the exit the " level " of that power-up will then be higher . as noted , you can theoretically do this indefinitely , adding an infinite number of " levels " to any power-up . of course , they game compensates automatically by making everything harder the deeper you go .

in galaxy data editor , on the morph ability for both viking - assault mode and viking - fighter mode , the random delay maximum field is set to 0.5 ( seconds ) . it is just a pre-transform delay for effect : ) it also explains the lack of delay on move commands , blink , stim , etc . ( they do not have this field set , and in fact may not have it at all )
yes , a quarry will keep chunks within its area of operation loaded before and after doing its thing . they will only be unloaded when the quarry block is removed . to test this , i simply set up a system that pumps items out of an ender chest ( from the ender storage mod ) into a regular chest near a quarry that had reached bedrock . then , i went to the nether , restarted the server for good measure , and put items into the corresponding ender pouch . they started disappearing , which means that the chunks in the overworld were still loaded .
the wood needed in the hearthfire dlc is distinct from the wood you can obtain from any chopping block . you are looking for sawn logs . these can be purchased from several log merchants in the game : aeri - anga 's mill in the pale bolund - the wood mill in falkreath gilfre - mixwater mill in eastmarch grosta - heartwood mill in the rift hert - half-moon mill in falkreath hod - wood mill in riverwood kharag gro-shurkul - solitude sawmill in haafingar thonnir - wood mill in morthal some of these merchants will also allow you to chop lumber from free if you complete enough radiant quests to raise their disposition . note that if you saw your own logs , the merchant must be nearby for you to actually receive the lumber .
the method i am about to explain technically works for any size grid , but it requires some knowledge that i do not know how to determine from scratch . if you want to do some searching online related to it , the method is generally referred to as " chasing lights " or " chasing the lights " . start by pushing the buttons on the second row corresponding to the lit cells on the top row , then the buttons on the third row corresponding to the lit cells in the second row , etc . this is exactly what you were already doing , chasing the lights down to the bottom row , which is where the name comes from . now , as you know , the tricky part comes when you have got a grid that is blank except for the bottom row . at this point , the way to finalize it is to push some specific buttons on the first row corresponding to the lit cells on the bottom row , and then chase the lights down from the top again . if you pushed the right first-row buttons , when you complete the second chase , the puzzle will be solved . as far as i know , you have to just know which buttons to push on the top row to correspond to a specific pattern that was left on the bottom row after the initial chase . if you can figure out a method of determining the right ones to push on the top , you can probably use a very similar method to generalize this to any size grid . i do not know a method for this though , so i will , uh , leave that as an exercise to the reader . for the classic 5x5 version of the puzzle , it turns out that there are only 7 possible patterns on the bottom row after the initial chase down , so i am just going to list the 7 possible patterns and the corresponding first-row buttons to press for each . buttons are numbered from left to right . similar lookup tables can probably be found for the other sizes online .
if your teammate hits a nidalee trap and walks into a bush you are in , it does not reveal the entire bush , only the x-distance visible radius around him/her . if he/she comes into the x-distance with you in the bush you will be visible as well . for a distance example , see this .

training : danger rooms ( a room full of lever-operated upright wooden training spears ) . this is considered an exploit by some , because of its absurd effectiveness , but if you want your dwarves to be real good at fighting real fast , this is the way to do it . remember to use wooden training spears , which are virtually harmless , and not menacing spikes , which are deadly weapons even when made of wood . stick 10 spears in each trap for maximum effectiveness , and remember to give your dwarves armor , shields and weapons of a type you want them to train with . removing shields will accelerate the speed of weapon skill training , but will obviously stop shield user training . equipment : iron armor at the bare minimum , steel if possible . a dwarf can ( and should ) wear chain mail , a breastplate , greaves , boots , gloves , a helmet , and a cloak . for weapons , axes and hammers are generally the best , axes excelling against unarmored enemies and hammers against armored enemies . chance to hit is increased for masterwork ( x2 ) and artifact ( x3 ) weapons ( less skilled soldiers will get greater benefits from high-quality weapons than legendary soldiers ) , so train up your weaponsmith . all dwarves should also carry a shield , you can get away with shields made of wood or inferior metals if you are light on steel . scouting : remember that not all goblins are created equal . there is little you can do to prepare your dwarves to fight goblin lashers . people call them sith warriors for a reason : whips ( and scourges ) are effectively lightsabers , penetrating most armor due to a very small contact area and a massive velocity , however high shield user and dodger skills will give a good boost to your dwarves ' chances . have a backup plan to deal with an entire squad of lashers . goblin bowmen are also dangerous , try fighting them in winding corridors to prevent them from shooting up your advancing dwarves , or counter them with your own elevated crossbow-wielding dwarves behind fortifications . all other goblin weapon specialties are pretty much equivalent ; well-armored and armed dwarves should be able to deal with them relatively safely .
does magic find affect the quality of what a merchant has to offer ? stacked to 90% , and did 80 checks with 0% and 80 checks with 90% in nightmare difficulty , the appearance of white and yellow items in the town vendors were the same ( less then 0.2% difference ) , granted this is only 160 complete checks , and is a small sample size , but with this said , i am saying no , it has no effect on the results .
cleaner costs come directly out of your available spending cash . i entered a solo jewelry store heist with 32,990,000 offshore and 3 , 072 , 690 in ready cash . i started murdering civilians left and right , and managed to escape with three bags . this is what i saw when i finished the stage . apparently you have a direct debit account with the cleaner . one thing worth noting is that depending on the offshore percentage , you will have to steal more cash to compensate for killing a civilian than the stated on-screen cost . for example , when the offshore percentage is 0.25 , killing a $2,000 civilian really costs you $8,000 worth of heist loot .
i was frustrated with the same issue . i believe that the lifetime coins challenges do not start counting until after the objective is activated ( which could be a bug ) . you probably activated gold miner first , collected nearly 400k coins , and then completed a separate challenge that then activated midas touch . from that point all coins collected applied to both midas touch and gold miner , but because gold miner was open first , it has more progress . and , of course , the midas touch progress bar is going to fill half as fast as gold miner 's . i actually stopped playing after i noticed this . even though they decreased the +2 gem powerup to level 9 , it will just take too long to complete the lifetime challenges . if it had been counting my true lifetime progress , they would have been completed already .
shift -click the item in your inventory while having a chat box open , just like in world of warcraft .
no , this is not a bug . i am unsure when the last time you played was , but when i started playing in may 2013 , i experienced this as well . it means that whatever you were trying to trap triggered it , but got away . as per the wiki article on trapping , where you can also see a picture to verify if you scroll down : sometimes , a trap may fall but not catch an animal that has moved out of the way too quickly . after a while , it'll appear to shake with a creature inside , but it'll lose durability if picked up in either state . to reduce the chance of this happening , i place my traps right on top of the rabbit holes . this makes it so that they are trapped immediately right when they exit . i would suggest using this method , as the durability loss on traps without catching anything will hurt your efficiency in food gathering .
assuming the mechanics are the same as they have been across the series . . . the major difference is that axes do bash damage while swords do cut damage . one thing to remember is that with exceedingly rare exception , there is no such thing as a " neutral " damage . all damage is of an element , either magical or physical . and so enemies have varying tolerances - some things are easier to slash than to smash , and vice versa . for example , rocky or shell type enemies tend to either be weak to or take normal damage from bash type , but would take reduced damage from cut and stab type . to that point , if i recall correctly , axes and staves are the only default-to-bash type weapons in the game . whilst swords , whips , and katanas are the default-to-cut type weapons . as such , be cognizant of your desired elemental coverage - axes are pretty much the major source of bash damage for standard physical fighters , barring the traditional combat medic builds . past that , the other main difference is in the skillsets of the class in question . usually the attack sets of the two skill trees for any given multi-weapon class tend to present two wildly different attack strategies . as such , in some ways , skill access is a more deciding factor than raw attack power , at least late game .
coupled with the " slug " ammo , you can do some serious damage with a scoped shotgun . it is got both short range lethality and long range damage . there is some nsfw language in this video , but the guy 's having fun with it , so : shotguns do small amounts of damage at range , but if you have got one that is semi- or full- auto , you can take people down faster than you had think . when you factor in latency , shotguns with pellet-style ammo can sometimes win simply because they fire more bullets simultaneously .
there are 8 categories of weapons , each with their own formula : for unarmed damage : dmg = [ 11 x random ( 1~1.125 ) - def ] x str x ( lv+str ) /256 . with brawler license , it becomes : dmg = [ ( lv+str ) /2 x random ( 1~1.125 ) - def ] x str x ( lv+str ) /256 for one-handed swords , two handed swords , spears , crossbows and rods : dmg = [ atk x random ( 1~1.125 ) - def ] x [ 1 + str x ( lv+str ) /256 ] for poles : dmg = [ atk x random ( 1~1.125 ) - mdef ] x [ 1 + str x ( lv+str ) /256 ] for maces : dmg = [ atk x random ( 1~1.125 ) - def ] x [ 1 + mag x ( lv+mag ) /256 ] for katanas and staves : dmg = [ atk x random ( 1~1.125 ) - def ] x [ 1 + str x ( lv+mag ) /256 ] for axes , hammers and handbombs : dmg = [ atk x random ( 0~1.111 ) - def ] x [ 1 + str x ( lv+vit ) /128 ] for daggers , ninja swords and bows : dmg = [ atk x random ( 1~1.125 ) ] - def ] x [ 1 + str x ( lv+spd ) /218 ] for guns and measures : dmg = [ atk x random ( 1~1.125 ) ] ^2 and bonus , for magic : dmg = [ pow x random ( 1~1.125 ) - mdef ] x [ 2 + mag x ( lv+mag ) /256 ) ] this means several things : you should use different weapons depending on the character : basch will be better with weapons focused on strength , like swords , while ashe and penelo will be better with weapons focused on magic ( i think ) like maces the second stat ( for example speed for daggers ) becomes more and more important as level goes up you should use different weapons based on the enemies . some have really high def , but low mdef ( use poles , guns , or magic ) , while others have low def , but high mdef ( avoid magic and poles ) . i usually try to have my characters focus either on a physical weapon and magic , or a physical and a magical weapon ( like 2h swords and poles ) ( this is based on this guide )
from memory , there was a legion of keyboard shortcuts , but the only way to interact with objects was by mousing over and clicking them ; i am 90% sure there was no way to " tab " between interactive items , and , for better or worse , baldur 's gate was way before the current age of context sensitive controls . even if there was , you had have to have a way to move your party/characters and control orientation of the formations of your party . . . i know it is baldur 's gate , but it is probably more trouble than it is worth :p you could buy a mini mouse , or go even further back to nethack , or try out dwarf fortress . edit : nowadays one can buy baldur 's gate for ipad and android tablets ( and bgii for the ipad ) , which means you can play without a mouse . . just not on the pc versions we know and love ; )
try the ones of killing the enemies in two turns when you have bigger level than them . take care if you are on the 4th barony because the campaign may reset to the second battle of that map if you travel to other maps ( once you have the town i suggest you first unlock the 2 heroes before trying to complete that barony ) . 2010/10/01: hidden quests the list below is completed . some rewards may change ( the ones that are not consumables ) if you post this list somewhere else , show the source and the author enjoy it :d the witch ( 1st barony 1st quest ) -> giant worm ( consumable ) giant worm -> eagle quest ( 4th barony 1st quest ) -> dragon egg ( consumable ) . dragon egg -> airborne ( 1st barony ) -> horned amulet ( legendary badge ) red key -> the lesson ( 1st barony ) -> iron shackles ( consumable ) iron shackles -> lair raider ( 5th barony ) -> fire rune ( consumable ) fire rune -> ceremony ( 4th barony ) -> bony amulet ( legendary badge ) brotherhood ( 2nd barony 1st quest ) -> coffee machine ( consumable ) coffee machine -> honey honey ( 5th barony ) -> no badge , no consumable safari ( 2nd barony ) -> prayer book ( consumable ) prayer book -> sage miyagi ( 3rd barony ) -> no badge , no consumable birthday party ( 3rd barony 1st quest ) -> sword ( main quest item ) sword -> unlocks a main quest the master ( 4th barony ) -> cuckoo clock ( consumable ) cuckoo clock -> the precious ( 2nd barony ) -> no badge , no consumable gold race ( 5th barony ) -> magical barrel and earth ward ( 2 consumables ) magical barrel -> vegetarian ( 6th barony ) -> medal of honor ( consumable ) medal of honor -> treasure hunt ( 3rd barony ) -> frosty amulet ( legendary badge ) earth ward -> lies ( 3rd barony ) -> no badge , no consumable dirty job ( 5th barony ) -> silver harp ( consumable ) silver harp -> the siren ( 1st barony ) -> lorgnette ( consumable ) lorgnette -> tournament ( 4th barony ) -> fanged amulet ( legendary badge ) water skins ( 5th barony ) -> singing fish ( consumable ) singing fish -> giant fish ( 1st barony ) -> ancestral key ( consumable ) ancestral key -> the chancellor ( 3rd barony ) -> snowy amulet ( legendary badge ) the traitor ( 6th barony ) -> ancient scroll ( consumable ) ancient scroll -> the traitor ( 6th barony , battle for the treasure ) -> eyeless skull ( consumable ) eyeless skull -> diabolo 2 or diabolo 3 ( 6th barony , both ) -> one eyed skull ( consumable ) one eyed skull -> diabolo 2 or 3 ( the one still not done ) -> living skull ( main quest item ) catastrophe ( 6th barony ) -> rusty spanner ( consumable ) rusty spanner -> bomb squad ( 4th barony ) -> robot spider ( consumable ) robot spider -> bug infestation ( 2nd barony ) -> bloody amulet ( legendary badge ) the door ( 6th barony ) -> big cyan key and voodoo doll ( consumable ) voodoo doll -> ghost town ( 2nd barony ) -> tin foil hat ( consumable ) tin foil hat -> impnapping ( 5th barony ) -> wicked amulet ( legendary badge ) big cyan key -> treasure ( or town if you unlock west spot ) -> ore detector ( consumable ) ore detector -> impbot ( 2nd barony ) -> shiny ore ( consumable ) shiny ore -> ashes to ashes ( 1st barony ) -> fanged amulet ( legendary badge ) tips : i open the most of the treasures at level 25 , but before killing the behemont . so i just get a tone of purple items and just 2 gold ( non-badge ) items . i think that the chance of gold items will rise if you open the chests after killing the behemont . once i discover how to kill it , i will make an update .
yes , you can profit off of these missions . what you can do is when lester gives you a mission , he normally says something stock related . the most obvious of which are assassination missions against ceo 's . invest in the opposing companies stock ! once he says something stock related , cancel the mission ( if you want all characters to invest ) and make that stock purchase . then , the stock you bought will sky-rocket , and allow you to make loads of money . lcn stock market - opposing companies : coolbeans - beanmachine burgershot - up-an-atom clucking bell - tacobomb flyus - airemu gopostal - postop bilkington - dollarpills pisswasser - logger mazebank - bankofliberty redwood - debonaire slaughter , slaughter and slaughter - bullhead radiolossantos - worldwidefm ecola - raine you can find lots more tips on this thread post here .
a mission type receives an experience penalty for that type of mission when the player repetitively plays the mission " too much " . the main way to avoid this is to keep some sort of rotation of missions that you like . i personally like mallcrasher and jewelry heist a lot but i accumulate high penalties very quickly . to prevent this , i throw in four stores , rats , and nightclub ( i like keeping things easy ) . avoid doing the same mission more than once in a row and you should be okay . more comments in regards to experience reduction found here .

to directly answer the question , road maintenance is listed as " tile improvement maintenance " , when you mouse over your treasury/income in the top left . you can see a circled example in the screenshot below . as for the details : roads cost to maintain both inside and outside your borders because my conclusions are contrary to previous info we had about road maintenance in neutral territory . . . pics or it did not happen ! exibit 1: prince difficulty , some roads in , some out . as you can see , i have 4 roads in my territory , and one outside , costing me a total of 5 maintenance . i have no other roads anywhere else . i wish i had taken a screenshot of the previous turn . the next time i find myself in this situation , i will take a pair of screenshots and replace this single picture . either way , remember you can always try it yourself to be sure . yay science ! exibit 2: settler difficulty , all roads out . thanks to @dma57361 's questions , i checked a different difficulty and a different number of roads outside the borders , namely all of them . on settler difficulty , building roads only outside of my borders , i still ended up with maintenance for the roads , so clearly they do cost . edited to account for difficulty , now that i have completed more extensive testing . roads cost the same to maintain in your own territory , and in neutral territory . how much varies by difficulty : road maintenance is only ever a whole number . in case of decimal remainder , always round down . for example , on settler , 2 roads cost 0.68 , which clearly got rounded down to 0 . to find each of these , i built roads either only inside , or only outside my borders at a time . this confirmed the same results for inside and out , but got me only close numbers . then @oak used his powers of xml scrying , and found the exact numbers for us . since so many difficulties are 1g , ( and the ones that are not are the easier difficulties anyway , ) and for our general happiness , i hereby declare "1g " an acceptable approximation for all further calculations relating to road maintenance . hurray ! when next i can test , i will re-test road 's in another nation 's borders , to clean up the next section ! same bat-time . same bat-channel . roads do not cost to maintain inside another nation 's borders edit : this section is suspect until i complete further testing , since one road did not cause me maintenance . my mistake for not setting up a proper control . this still may be completely true , but i need to test on different difficulties and compare with similar numbers of roads in my borders and in neutral territory . in the game these two pictures originated from , i had no roads , and built a road inside each another civilization 's borders , and a city-state 's borders . i can not verify that they were costing any gold to the land 's owner ( rome 's income was fluctuating quite a bit ) , but i can say for sure they were costing me nothing . this is likely what bwarner saw that caused the error . there may be other effects that change which roads cost to maintain , but these seem to be the major ones . anyone found anything not explained by these . ps as with any screenshot heavy post , i do my best to crop/scale the images to reasonable sizes without losing the important parts , such as the circled text . they still end up crowding the page , for which i am sorry .
in the situation you described above : target drones . the reasoning is because that is guaranteed damage . the drones will die ; if you target the hatch , it might live and his drones can happily go back to mining after your army is killed/driven out . killing drones also gives you an economic advantage . with the zerg race , the player has to actively make the decision of , " am i going to spend this larva to make a drone , or an attacking/defending unit " . by killing the drone you slow down his economy , force him to spend the larva to keep up with you economically ( assuming you keep making harvesters/expanding ) , and weaken his attacking/defending force because he used the larva to produce a drone instead of a zergling , roach , muta , etc .
i confirm the following after after some testing : the ring does not work if equipped by your follower the goblin is summoned when equipping the ring and follows you around as long as the ring stays equipped , unequipping it will reset the item counter dying will reset the item pickup counter , which means you must start over with collecting normal-quality items after you die exiting a game resets the counter exiting an act also resets the counter the goblin will not pick up player dropped normal-quality items nor will it pick up normal quality crafting mats the goblin will pick up low quality item as well it seems that when you go from zone to zone , the game unequips and re-equips your items big areas to farm the normal/low-quality items : the cursed hold ( act 1 ) halls of agony ( act 1 ) battlefields of eternity ( act 5 ) legendary drop rate is currently unknown . patch 2.0.5 notes the following changes : legendary drop chance doubled rare items dropped will now always have six affixes the counter for picking up normal-quality items will now persist through death , act transitions , and un-equipping the item ( note : this still will not persist across game sessions ) the goblin will now play a sound when its counter reaches max and it drops an item

i answered a similar question to this : how do i get more guns ? . noticed that your question was posted a few hours before that though . this is the new " arms deal " update which went live on 14/08/2013 . valve released a really good faq on it , which can be found here . the bits of interest for your particular question , " how do i get item drops ? ": timed weapon drops , just by playing on official and community servers ( vac enabled ) in any game mode . opening dropped weapon cases with a weapon case key . trade weapons with other players through steam 's trading interface . purchase them from other players through the steam marketplace . regarding the first point , these are obtained for play time over the course of a week . as your play time increases , the drop rate will slow down . this is reset when the week rolls over . not sure the start day or time of a week though . i am not 100% sure where you will get the weapon case keys . the below quote suggests that you buy these : this update will also actively support the cs:go competitive community with the introduction of the esports weapon case . a portion of the proceeds from sales of esports case keys will go towards prize purses at competitive events . hope that helps .
" alt + shift " keyboard shortcut is your friend . it does " set your entire computer to qwerty " . but it is easy and quick enough to swap between " azerty " and " qwerty " that it should not bother you much . but if you have to write ingame . . . then i know no other option than rebinding , and if you can not , you are stuck .
yes they do . all bumps are +25% , pd=power damage , wd=weapon damage , prs=power recharge speed . values are summarized from the wiki .
i have played a barbarian since release now , read several forums for barbarian discussion from time to time , and i am in hell difficulty right now . i will give you a break-down of what you , and potential readers of your question , have to expect in the future when playing a barbarian . all the way through normal , barbarian was a blast to play as dps . you do not have to invest heavily in vitality . in fact , i went with strength and other stats over vitality wherever i could , simply because i wanted to be badass . and surely , i was . you will crush the skulls of legions of enemies with your fingertips . what this means is : in normal , play whatever you want , it will not matter . however , throughout act iv you might want to keep some gear with more vitality that you find , since act i in nightmare will be a big change . for me , i had around 4k life i think , and champion packs killed me in a matter of seconds . in nightmare , the first thing you will probably have to do is change your gear out for some gear that has higher vitality on it . the exact amount that you need will probably vary with your playstyle and build , but you will have a hard time if you have less than 10k hp by the middle of act ii , and about at least 17-18k at the end of act iv ( i personally had 22k , which made playing really comfortable ) . you can reach much higher life-numbers in nightmare , if you want to . i think it is probably possible to reach 30k and a bit further , if you purely use vitality-focused gear and gems , however , it is probably not necessary . with my 22k , i already did not do an enormous amount of damage , and it can only get less with more hp . i am still at the beginning of hell , but from the few champion packs that i have seen , i think that what most people on forums write might become true very quickly : playing a dps-focused barbarian in hell is very hard , and impossible in inferno . when you get to inferno , simple " white " mobs will hit you for 30-40k . this means that you have to have a lot of hp to survive for enough time to make a difference . this usually means that you have to favor vitality over strength wherever you can , and you also pretty much have to use a shield + 1h weapon , since the lost survivability with a two-hander or two one-handers is usually not bearable . however , i can not give exact numbers on what hp-numbers you need to reach in the various inferno acts , since my experience in that difficulty are just theoretical ( reading in forums ) for now . another thing i would like to mention , which probably is true for all classes , is that you should also look into raising your actual resistances ( physical resistance + elements ) , since they are pretty easy damage reduction , especially early on . i have around 100 or so intelligence on my gear , just because some good gear that i needed happened to have intelligence on it as well , and just from those little points and war cry + the rune that raises your resistances , my damage from everything is reduced by a little over 10% , which is pretty huge . since the rune also increases your resistance percentage , instead of a flat value , i am assuming that it will become much more important later on than , for example , the rune that raises your hp by 10% ( remember : essentially , taking 10% less damage is the same as having 10% more hp ) .
the hatcheries spawn a different amount of larvae based on your difficulty . 6 on hard and brutal , 9 on casual and normal , rather than 3 larva like in multiplayer . you will be able to build up more larva with more hatcheries . it is how they managed it in the starcraft:brood war days . i am sure the 300 minerals spent on extra hatcheries is something that is easily affordable in the campaign . your other option would be to constantly build units and hope that you have the correct composition . ( which is not really the zerg way of playing ) .
no , which makes me feel a little bit sad . there is only few cosmetic changes ( for example with like with cornelius slate ) but you can not change ending as far as i know . from gamespot forum . . . look up for the gamespot lounge interview with ken levine , he says that 2k wanted multiple endings but he said " nope " . also you can watch on youtube interview ( 4 - 6 min ) how ken levine say that they wanted to " make player experiance that he had to make choices " but also he tells that this choices not change plot .
the 4 people you have to fart on are : mayor of south park . ( located in her office ) father maxi . ( located on a bench outside of the mayor office ) principal victoria . ( located in the community center ) minister of montreal ( locked in a cave in cananda . you need to fart on him before talking to him or he disappears forever ) . this achievement might be glitchy . i for sure had farted on everyone , but after farting on the minister of montreal , i had to take another round of farting on the south park officials . i had the achievement unlock after using the ' cup a spell ' fart on everyone .
enchanting is very different from what was found in torchlight 1 . enchanting adds magical properties that can also be removed ( deliberately ) by an enchanter . but enchanting can no longer wipe an item ; that is , enchanting cannot affect existing stats in any way . the removal mechanic exists so you can spend gold to get an item " just right " .

as far as i know , it keeps locked while you are in the past . @jeff mercado seems to agree with me , and he seems to have gone through every pixel of this game . furthermore , no walkthrough i could find mentioned any use to the side door . as i see it , the door is there for consistency throughout the game , but does not serve an actual purpose in the past other than say " if there is a door in the present , then there has to be one in the past , unless someone went and altered the temple , made out of stone " at some point between the two times " . which brings us back to the path . why would there not be a path on the other side ? why have a door that leads to nothing ? this is of course speculation , but the path likely leads to faron woods and the skyview temple , as it does in the present . and since you do not need to access those locations in the past , the door remains locked . i suppose it also allowed the developers to not have to create a new , younger-looking location .

each skill is in one of five categories : mutation , strenght , general , agility or passing . all of these categories are not available for every player type . and some may be accessable only if you roll any double ( double 1s , double 2s , etc . ) these go by player types , not team races , so these may vary within your players . you will see under each category either normal ( always accessable ) double ( accesasble on doubles ) no ( never accessable ) also , if the total of the roll is high enough , you can in stead choose to raise one of the players attributes as follows 10 or higher : raise ma by 1 11 or higher : raise ag by 1 12 ( double 6s ) : raise st by 1 what ever the roll , you can only choose either one skill to gain or one attribute to raise . for more information , see the living rulebook ( page 40 deals with these rolls ) . the game follows these rules pretty faitfully , with some exceptions and blitz mode spesific additions .
the secret was not a recipe : here is notch talking about it on reddit : we have tried adding secrets to the game before . small things , like obscure crafting recipes or weird behavior , and everything always gets figured out immediately . no matter how obscure we make a new feature , it is fully documented within hours of a new release . this is awesome , and a great example of how dedicated some minecraft players are , but it also means we can not really hide anything good in the game even if we tried . so a while ago , i did some intentionally obscure code in the title screen to switch two letters around , making it say " minceraft " ( old running gag , there is even a " minceraft " mockup t shirt design we did ) instead of " minecraft " on every 10000th game launch or so , and nobody found it ! i was so happy about that , i finally knew something about the game the players did not know . flash forward to this gdc a few days ago , i am doing an interview with chris hecker , and he asks me if there is anything nobody has found in the game , and i say yes . i should've said no , but i said yes . then i start getting emails and tweets about it , people start getting excited , and knowing how minor the secret is , i try to tell people it is a very minor secret . that seems to fuel the flames . a reporter from a well known gaming site wants to run an article on it , and i tell him not to . getting people hyped up about an intentional typo is not really a good way to spend everyone 's time . there is a lot of cool stuff to learn from this , though . one is that it is possible to hide stuff in plain sight , but once people go looking for it , they will find it . another thing is that people seem to want to get excited over things , even if you tell them it is nothing major . i am impressed and relieved you found it . i will not comment on it outside of this subreddit . source : reddit and planet minecraft
yes you can . all campaign missions are re-playable individually so you can play them again on any of the difficulties ( for the sake of achievements , other story choices and side quests ) . same as you could in wings of liberty using the mission archives , since this is something that depends on the basic game rather than expansion . " relive every exciting moment by unlocking the master archives . after completing the heart of the swarm campaign , you can use the master archives to jump directly into any mission or replay any cinematic . " the standard archives are unlocked after the 4th mission ( "harvest of screams " or " domination" ) .
you will have everything from your legacy on the new server ( unlocks , level , etc . ) and the old should be unaffected . it will combine things if you have different legacies ( i.e. . , a character already on the new server ) with different unlocks so you get the best of both worlds , including the higher legacy level . for slightly more detail see dulfy on reddit .
artifacts are gained by using archaeologists . the archaeologist unit is unlocked by the archaeology technology in the industrial era , and also can only be built in cities that have built a university . once you have the archaeology technology , even before you make an archaeologist , you will be able to see basic antiquity sites . move an archaeologist to one , and they will be able to work the tile as workers do other tiles . this takes a handful of turns ( depending on game speed ) , and when they are done you will have the option to gain an artifact , or to create a landmark improvement on the tile . if you see an antiquity site in another civilization 's territory , you can still work it , but doing so will potentially anger the other civilization , in much the same way as converting their cities does when they have their own religion . lastly , if there are several other civilizations working archaeology sites , you can try getting the exploration social policy tree . having all policies in the tree unlocks hidden antiquity sites , which function exactly the same as regular antiquity sites , but cannot be seen nor worked by civilizations without the full exploration tree , which means there may be less competition .
generally , you will be more likely to find people to invade as a blue phantom near the end of the game and with a high soul memory . the reason is this : you can only invade players who have the status of a sinner . to get this , they have to have accumulated at least 10 sin points . killing a player by invading him with the cracked red eye orb and killing an npc both increase a player 's sin count by 1 . being killed by a blue sentinel decreases the count by 1 . ( source ) red eye orbs can be found as treasure , but not in a great number . the only way to have a reliable endless source of these orbs is joining the brotherhood of blood and winning them in arena duels there . but to do this , players first have to find this covenant , which is in an optional area in huntsman 's copse . unlike heide 's tower of flame , where you can join the blue sentinels , this area is not available from the start , and since the order in which you progress the game is not linear , it is possible to find this covenant late into the game or not at all . also , the amount of npcs in the game is low and since there is mostly no real benefit in killing npcs ( and you need the services of many ) , there are not many people doing that . to add to that , you have to be within the soul memory range of the person you want to invade . soul level does not have an influence on match-making . according to the fextralife wiki , you have to be within 25% of the other player 's soul memory , but there is no proof for this value at the time . it is sure , however , that the range is a percentage , so it increases with the total amount of the memory . as soon as you reach a soul memory of 15 million ( which normally takes several playthroughs or a lot of pvp ) , you have reached the " top tier " and can connect with anyone above 15 million souls ( source ) . to sum up , while red phantom invaders can invade anyone within their soul memory range , the victims of blue sentinels have to meet the sinner criteria as well , which is not easily obtained , which is why it is harder for them to find other players . generally , you will have a much easier time finding targets towards the end of the game , because the chance of players having sinned is much higher . the reason why the guardian 's seal has an even less chance of connecting is that the requirements for that are very limiting . to get summoned , another player has to be within your memory range and a member of the way of blue while being invaded by a player with a red eye orb . since you almost never get invaded at low levels for the above reasons , players generally do not stay in this covenant for long . and when they progressed further into the game where they actually could be invaded , they will have found the much more rewarding other covenants , so do not count on ever getting summoned with the ring . i do not know if you have to be within the same area to be summoned , because it never happened to me . my personal experience is that , at a soul memory of about 2 million , i managed to invade frequently in drangleic castle . here are some general tips for blue invasions : try invading in the furthest area you have progressed in , because the chance of others being within your soul memory range is the highest there . do not give up when the message " no world to invade " appears after using a cracked eye orb . this happens frequently , and you should just assign the orbs to a quick slot and try again right after the message . in my experience in drangleic castle mentioned above , i managed to invade about one in every 15 orb uses . do not try to invade as a blue phantom before you have reached the brotherhood of blood area yourself , because it is likely other players in your range will not have sinned . if you do not manage to invade at all , just keep playing . the higher your soul memory , the higher is your victim 's soul memory , and so is the chance he has sinned . being summoned with the guardian 's seal happens close to never , so do not expect to get any summons there . if you have not progressed very far in the game , but want to play pvp , your chances are far better in the other covenants . in the bell keeper covenant , i alerady got summoned frequently with a soul memory lower than 500k . sometimes i could not even get the summoning ring off fast enough before the next one . pvp chances are also good with the rat king covenant in the grave of saints . another advantage of them is that you get valuable pharros lockstones and titanite chunks as rewards , while the blue sentinels get nothing but the satisfaction of punishing the guilty . with your soul level and memory , you should find good fights in both covenants . of course , if you do not mind becoming a sinner yourself , you could also join the brotherhood of blood . they always find victims , since they can invade anyone in any place . regarding your question about pvp hotzones : there is a hotzone in the iron keep , on the bridge at the first bonfire , where i always found red summon signs and dragon eyes with a memory of around 1.5 million and higher . most players might have a higher soul memory than yours , so you should try that place later . from what i have heard , sinners can be found frequently on ng+ , because of the high soul memory range and the high chance of having sinned enough sometime during the first cycle .
as zombies mode is technically a ' cooperative campaign ' mode ( rather than a ' multiplayer ' game ) , the same auto-aim assist which exists in the single-player campaign carries over into zombie games . so what is happening is that you are turning in circles , and as your crosshair passes over a zombie it slows down your turning . it helps if you wanted to aim/shoot at that zombie , but in other scenarios ( quick turning to run from/melee a closer zombie for example ) it can be quite annoying . you can disable aim assist in the settings . i do not own black ops 2 , but if memory serves from earlier games it is under the Look Sensitivity sub-menu and is called Target Assist . it appears black ops 2 ' s zombie mode has it is own aim assistance , separate to the option you can toggle in the settings menu ( source ) . which can not be completely disabled . this may be a bug on treyarch 's end , or by design . you could try contacting them with the relevant details , to see if this is the case .

dual-wielding does not mean you attack twice as often . there is a slight attack-speed benefit , but this is apparently being offset for you by the lower damage from the offhand weapon . according to this thread on the forums , the formula for number of attacks per second is ( ( main hand aps*1.15 ) + ( off-hand aps*1.15 ) ) *1/2 which means that if you had two identical weapons , dual-wielding would give you a 15% attack speed bonus . the main reason to dual-wield is that you get the bonus attributes from both items . this does not mean much early on when attributes are not very strong , but is a big incentive later on . however , compared to a two-handed weapon that does more dps , there is not a clear winner . it will mostly come down to whether you have found better one-handed weapons or two-handed , and what your preference is for faster attack versus stronger attack .
yes , sockets count as one of the the +magical properties when crafting , bashiok said : oh . . . and regardless of how many sockets you have , it only counts as a single affix . if an item rolls up 2 or 3 sockets , that still only accounts for a single affix spot on the item . . . . gem sockets , regardless of how many , only account for one of those 4 affixes check out this answer for how many sockets you might be able to get .
according to sources on the blizzard forum , the secret level is called whimsyshire : whimsyshire is essentially a single-level dungeon , much like the dungeons you find randomly while exploring the wilderness . just like these random dungeons , it has chests and other lootable objects , plus a plethora of monsters , including some champion and unique monsters . level-wise , it contains monsters and loot that are roughly on par with the first act of nightmare ( if you are visiting the normal variant - i assume that it is roughly on par with the first act of the difficulty one harder than the difficulty you enter the portal in ) - nothing super difficult or super awesome . it may be worth visiting/farming if you have cleared the difficulty you are on , but are having trouble with the first act of the next difficulty . otherwise , it is probably likely to be underwhelming . in order to visit whimsyshire , you must craft a staff of herding , and take it to a specific area in act 1 . the staff of herding unlocking whimsyshire requires a staff of herding , which can be crafted at the blacksmith for 50,000 gold and requires the following items : black mushroom - cathedral level 1 the mushroom in a patch of mushrooms that occasionally spawn on level 1 of the cathedral ( screenshot ) . when you enter the room , your hero will remark about the unusual mushrooms . the room it spawns in always looks the same so you can look for it in the minimap . ( minimap screenshot ) . if you are past this point in the story , go to act 1 , mission 4: reign of the black king . travel from the new tristram waypoint to the cathedral garden , and then walk out the gate and back around to the front of the cathedral . open the door and descend to cathedral level 1 . leoric 's shinbone - leoric 's manor the shinbone is found occasionally in the fireplace of leoric 's manor . from the entrance to the manor , walk forward to the staircase , and hang a right . the room with the fireplace is on the first floor on the right side . a large painting of an old man hangs over the fireplace . if the shinbone is present , there will be logs in the fireplace . click the logs to get the bone . ( screenshot ) . if you are past this point in the story , return to act 1 , mission 9: the imprisoned angel . take the waypoint to leoric 's manor . backtrack through the manor into the room with the large statue overlooking a double staircase , and then head into the room to the northeast on your minimap . wirt 's bell - caldeum bazaar squirt the peddler sells this item at the hidden camp in act 2 . this vendor was moved in patch 1.0.4 to stand just up and to the right of the waypoint in the hidden camp . the item is on the " miscellaneous " tab . the cost for the bell is 100,000 gold . liquid rainbow - mysterious cave in dahlgur oasis from the act 2 waypoint " path to the oasis , " travel southeast . zaven the alchemist may be here , and if so you can save him to access the cave . ( screenshot ) the item is in a the " mysterious chest " which also may not spawn , even if you are in the right dungeon . if you are past this point , load act 2 , mission 7: blood and sand . take the " path to oasis " waypoint , as noted above . gibbering gemstone - caverns of frost in fields of slaughter this item drops from a " purple " class monster named chiltara that has a chance of spawning in the second level of caverns of frost , a random dungeon that may or may not appear in the fields of slaughter . other dungeons may appear here , but you can only find this item in the caverns of frost . from the waypoint " the bridge of korsikk " travel almost due east . you should see a small cluster of debris that has a small , u-shaped indentation in it . ( screenshot ) the dungeon may spawn northwest , or southeast of this debris . ( there are other potential locations , but these are the fastest 2 to check ) ensure this is the caverns of frost before clearing it ! if you have passed this point , load act 3 , mission 6: siegebreaker . take the waypoint to " the bridge of korsikk " as noted above . plans for the staff of herding - great span this item is a random drop from izual , who is a midboss on the great spire . unfortunately , there is not a " fast " quest checkpoint for this one - you are going to have to start act 4 , mission 4: prime evil , and then fight through the silver spire level 1 in order to get to the great span . izual tends to favor attacks that freeze you in place , so bring any skills you know which can break his freezing spell . many of the " movement " skills ( ie , spirit walk ) can do this . if you kill izual and he does not drop the plans , you will have to exit out , reset the quest to " quest start " and start over again , fighting through silver spire level 1 . for this reason , i would suggest being overleveled before you attempt this - fighting this area repeatedly is likely to be time consuming and frustrating if you can not just obliterate everything quickly . a few additional notes : given that most of these are random drops , in some cases from random monsters in random dungeons you can expect to invest a decent amount of work in getting each of these components . you may try to get the shinbone a dozen or more times , for instance . if you search the indicated area and do not find the item/dungeon/boss , you will have to exit back out to the character selection screen and resume the game again to get another chance . these items may spawn in other locations ; i have listed the locations where i or others have had good luck finding them .   the items are marked as " account bound " - so you will not be able to buy these at the auction house , for example . the staff of herding you create from this recipe only unlocks the normal difficulty variant of whimsyshire . to unlock whimsyshire on higher difficulties , you will need to upgrade the staff . you can find more information about how to find the plans for these upgrades in this question : how do i get higher difficulty plan : staff of herding ? opening whimsyshire once you have the staff , travel to new tristram by choosing any of the quests in act 1 past the point where the road to old tristram is open . from the new tristram waypoint , follow the road towards old tristram . when the path turns to the right past the abandoned houses , you will find a fissure in the ground along the southern edge of the path . nearby will be the ghost of the cow king . ( screenshot ) with the staff of herding in your inventory , clicking on the ghost will trigger a few lines of dialog , and then the fissure will open . other related questions : can i enter whimsyshire if i follow someone in my party with the staff of herding ? is there any achievement related to whimsyshire ? sharing whimsyshire crafting materials between difficulties do the staff of herding crafting items drop in all difficulties ? will a higher level staff of herding open the lower difficulty whimsyshire ? can you access the secret level in diablo 3 more than once per difficulty ?
everywhere . from every monster of an appropriate level for the pattern in question . aside from the components for the staff of herding , the infernal machine plan and keys and a handful of named magic items which are essentially easter eggs , there are no specific drop tables tied to any specific mob or location in diablo 3 . everything is completely random ( modified by magic find/nephalem valor as appropriate ) .

i think there is an inherit flaw to watching a replay of players at this caliber and saying : how could x beat y . if ret had been playing against me , any one of those attacks would have been successful . the fact that marrow is such a powerful player really says more about this replay than any description of what happened . that said there are a number of good approaches to dealing with turles as any race : bombardment contain sauron bombardment is usually the most obvious one . every race has a long range unit ( siege tank , brood lord , colossus , etc ) which they can leverage against a static defense . usually the key to implementation is being able to handle the back up defense . if you are bringing in broodlords , you need to have corruptors on hand to deal with viking/voidray/etc . since a large part of his economy is invested in these static defenses he will not be able to raise as large of a back up force . a contain strategy is based on the principal that he must movve out of his defenses as some point . while he is still in a strong position , without the support of static defense this tactic allows for you to pick off his advancing army thus reducing the potential resources of his army . this is a strategy that trades on patience and fast , guerrilla style attacks , rather than a frontal assault . eventually he will run out of money and you will be able to overcome any remaining static defenses . i have provided a decent replay of this in action . sauron zerg was made popular by the broodwars player julyzerg ( i will let you guess what race he played ) in the osl tournament in 2004 . prior to 2004 no zerg player had ever made it to the finals much less won , so julyzerg 's performance brought about the " zerg renaissance . " there really is no way to stop the sauron zerg other than to prevent it from happening . it leverages an impossible to over come economic advantage . i do not think i can accurately explain how it works without just showing you . the key difference between this and a contain strategy is that sauron zerg involves a frontal assault .

i believe the two differences are - eating candies does not increase your hp ( your hp will be 100 all game ) - the sorceress cannot improve your sword level beyond 5 ( "a mysterious force has prevented me from upgrading your sword " , or some such message ) . ( a third difference may be an increased sense of satisfaction when you beat the game : ) . enjoy ! )
the items for the staff of herding , including the plan : staff of herding are " account bound " meaning they are only available to your battle .netaccount . if you want to give it to your buddy the only way is giving him your account password , and you should not do that . you could say it is worth about as much as your battle .netaccount is worth : ) about your title questions : i killed izual about 5 times before it dropped . of course this is definitely not a scientific answer .
increasing ppm would have to lead to a higher passive credit earnings , as long as shops have stock to sale . the more people randomly delivered throughout the tiny death star , the more people who buy items from shops . how can we determine that ppm applies to passive credit earnings and not player activity ? as there is no way that the level 2 elevator , the nb200 commercial lift , the first available upgrade for the elevator in tiny death star , is generating 8 people per minute for the player to deliver . this rate means that the player would be present with a stream of bitizens spaced every 7.5 seconds after the delivery of the last bitizen . examining the second elevator upgrade , the insta-lift 2000 se , we can see it has a 12 ppm rating . this means a bitizen would have to be popping up every 5 seconds in the lift to be escorted to a level by the player . so we can conclude that if the information posted in tiny death star has any in-game meaning , then it must apply to the background bitizens that are arriving on the floors . for further information , we can look at the tiny tower wiki about elevators here : http://tinytowerwiki.com/elevators it notes that ppm = passengers per minute , the rate that people are delivered . since this rate is much too quick for passengers to be delivered by the player , it must apply to passive delivery ( bitizens being delivered by the elevator " in the background" ) .
i think you need to shoot it in the back to deal a fair amount of damage i sent both my squad members to the right of the starting wall and had them shoot at the sectoids . i lifted the walker and ran to the left flank this allow me to shoot at the walkers weak spot on its back hope this helps
no , while you spend time in a node ( ie , repairing your craft , organizing your crew or weapons , shopping , upgrading , in combat , etc ) there is no movement of the rebel fleet . they only move when you make a jump within a system . in a non-nebula system , jumping through nebula will make the rebel fleet slow dramatically . it is hard to estimate the effect exactly , but at a glance their progress seems to be halved . i do not believe that the effect is as dramatic in nebula-type systems . if you hover over a nebula jump node in the system , you can see this on the tooltip . there are also certain events that will either speed up or slow down the rebel advance . for instance , if you encounter a rebel scout and fail to destroy it before it charges its ftl drive , you will find that the next advance of the rebel fleet will be much larger . likewise , there are certain automated rebel craft that can be hacked to slow the fleet 's advance .
start by downloading minecraft_server . exe from the official minecraft website . place it in an empty folder somewhere on your computer and open it . you will see the world being created , and when it is done , it'll tell you so . as long as that program is open and running , your server will be available for connection . any computer on your lan will be able to connect to this server now . simply open minecraft , login and head into multiplayer . type in the lan address ( found here ) of the computer where the server is running , and hit connect . if it does not connect on the first try , give it a couple more tries . troubleshooting try changing your firewall settings ( xp , vista/7 ) . the application you are adding is minecraft_server . exe , the port is 25565 ( or port range 25565-25565 ) , and you want this on both tcp and udp protocols ( you may have to add a rule for each ) . try port forwarding on your router . if you have access to your router , open your router configuration webpage ( um , what ? ) and find the port forwarding section ( might be listed under applications and gaming ) . use the same ports and protocols as above . try setting the server to offline mode . close the server for a moment . go into the folder where minecraft_server . exe is sitting , and find the server.properties file ( may simply appear as server ) . open this with notepad and change online-mode from true to false . save it , close it , and start the server again . try connecting the computers directly to one another , via ethernet cable . this one will work as a last resort , and is handy for laptops or desktops which are fairly close together . if you are picking up wireless internet or have a second ethernet port in your computer , you will not even have to sacrifice your internet connection . instead of connecting by putting in your lan address in the server ip box , put in " localhost " ( without the quotes ) in the server ip box and try to connect .
it is important to realize that mushroom biomes only spawn as islands in the middle of oceans . so , if you want to look for one in a world that does not spawn you in one , you can not go walking to find one , you need to find an ocean , make a boat , and search the ocean for a mushroom island . i can not offer any personal experience of how easy it is to find one by that approach ( i have no idea whether most oceans contain one , more than one , or just have a chance of containing one ) .
in the same way that they do not run out of ammo , they are not affected by weight restrictions see here weight capacity each class has a different amount of weapons that it can hold at one time . if shepard is encumbered then limitations will be imposed . for example , power cooldowns will be extended . weight does not seem to affect the power cooldown times of squadmates .
yes , with one major caveat : you can only " consummate " a single romantic interest before the suicide mission , though you can dead-end yourself ( i.e. . , prevent further romance ) with all of the characters before this . to observe all romantic interactions within a single playthrough , simply play the game , as normal , until you complete the suicide mission . you can romance one of the available options during this part , but limit your social interactions to only this character ( so you do not accidentally lock yourself out of the other relationships prematurely ) . after you have beaten the main game , you can go back and start romancing the other love interests . ( you may have to do missions / visit planets in between to progress along the dialog trees ) eventually , the new character will refuse to go any further until you break up with your current love interest . if you do so , you should be able to jump directly into the romance scene the next time you speak with them ( this is the scene that normally plays just before the suicide mission ) . add another notch on sheperd 's bedpost , and continue on with the third potential romance . do note , you can only be romantically involved with a single character at a time , but you can see all possible romance outcomes in a single playthrough ( of a single gender , of course . fem shepperd will never be able to romance tali or miranda , for instance ) . the mass effect wiki has more information on romance in general .
no , this is not possible . a bullet is able to hit the same tank twice ( by bouncing of one point of armor , into another point ) . but it is not possible to bounce off and hit another tank . once a shell hits a vehicle it is " bound " that vehicle and can not hit anything else . the only way to hit two targets with one shell is by using high explosive shells , this mostly happens with spg shells landing right next to two targets , with the shockwave damaging both . source : wot battle mechanics richochet section

the percentage increase from crackerjack is 10% and crackerjack ii is 20% here is what i have observed . a normal pack in the winter isles - jabberguppy lotus bubbud sasquash gives 243xp without any bonuses . with crackerjack we get 266xp . with crackerjack ii we get 291xp . so lets compare with creature compendium - jabberguppy - 75xp lotus bubbud - 81xp sasquash - 87xp total xp = 75 + 81 +87 = 243xp . now with crackerjack it should be 243 + 10% = 243 + 24.3 = 267.3 which should be 267 . but it is not because the bonus is calculated per creature ! so it would be - jabberguppy - 75xp + 10% = 75+7.5 = 82.5 = 82xp lotus bubbud - 81xp + 10% = 81+8.1 = 89.1 = 89xp sasquash - 87xp + 10% = 87+8.7 = 95.7 = 95xp all fractions are rounded down . so now we get total to be total xp = 82 + 89 + 95 = 266xp ! !

normal mode should take you from levels 1-30 . nightmare mode should bring you from 30-50 . hell mode is tuned for level 50 characters and should take you to the level cap of 60 . inferno mode is designed for level capped players . you can not access inferno mode without reaching level 60 .
yes it will work , but you will need to download the ps3 firmware and put it on a usb stick for installation : to transfer the update data to your playstation 3 , save the file to a ps3 compatible storage device such as memory stick , memory stick duo , usb drive or psp . before starting , use your pc to create a folder named ' ps3' on the storage media or usb device . within the folder , create a folder named ' update ' ( this folder name is case sensitive and must appear in all capital letters ) . once the update folder has been created , download the ps3 system software update to this location . it will either request this when you turn the ps3 on for the first time after putting the hard drive in , or you may need to put it into service mode for it to install by following the instructions below , and then choosing the " system update " option : since the 2.5 update the ps3 has a recovery menu with the following options : restart system : restarts the playstation®3 system . restore default settings : reset all system settings back to default . restore file system : checks for corrupt/missing system files . rebuild database : rebuilds the os for the playstation®3 . restore ps3 system : fresh restore ; deletes everything and starts from scratch . system update : update the playstation®3 system how to get access to service mode : make sure the ps3 is turned off , press and hold the power button on the ps3 it will power on then power off . when it is off press and hold the power button again until you hear two consecutive beeps . it will ask for the controller to be connected via the usb cable , turn on the controller and you will have access to the menu . source : http://www.waltercedric.com/gadget/262-sony-ps3/1444-ps3-factoryservice-mode
the " misc .

a lot of game tweaks are possible for the pc version of mass effect 3 , both in terms of graphics and " cheats " , and can be done by editing coalesced . bin . most of the results you find when you google for how to do a tweak or cheat will tell you which ini file and variable to change , but not exactly how to do that . warning before you start : i do not recommend using any " cheats " or a modified coalesced . bin file if you are going to play multiplayer . you may end up banned . see here . the coalesced . bin file is basically a collection of variables that the game uses to determine different things , from graphical effects to key bindings to things like shield recharge rates . you can affect the game in fairly signficant ways by modifying this file . to do so , you will want to grab the me3 coalesced utility . me3 coalesced utility ? what ? it is a tool that unpacks the . bin file so that you can edit it , and then repacks it when you save . there are many ways you can do this , but this is the easiest to use tool that i have found . you can grab it here . so where is coalesced . bin ? its in your mass effect 3 install directory , under \biogame\cookedpcconsole . err . . . okay . where 's my mass effect 3 install directory ? i discuss how to find that here okay , i have got those . now what ? make a backup ( i.e. . , copy and paste somewhere ) of your coalesced . bin file first . you will want this as a backup in case something goes wrong , and also so you can swap back to it if you are going to play multiplayer . run the tool . go to file-> open . select the coalesced . bin file discussed above . you should get a screen that looks like this : okay , i am ready ! what settings can i tweak ? way more than i am going to go into . if you want to know if something specific is possible , either google for it or post a question and ask . one common usage will probably be to bind keys to commands so that you can manually trigger them in-game . for example , this is how the current answer about how to tweak your field of view does it . you smack a numpad key and it changes your fov . in general , you can do a lot of things this way by doing the following : go to bioinput . ini-> sfxgame-> sfxgamemodebase-> bindings ( see screenshot below ) on the right hand side , scroll to the bottom and enter something that looks something like this : ( name = " numpadzero " , command = " something" ) obviously , you could use numpadone , numpadtwo , or whatever you like . replace " something " with the actual command you wish to execute . here are a few example commands : fov 90 - as already mentioned , you could set the fov to 90 ( or any other number ) this way initcredits 9999999 - will set your credits to 9999999 initammo 999 - give yourself a bunch of ammo god - turn on god mode ( though instant-kill attacks can still kill you ) this page lists even more commands . again , this is about how to edit the file , not necessarily what to edit . if there is something you want , like how to unlock all weapons ( which you can do ) , google it and and you will probably quickly find the command you need . or ask a specific question about what you want to do ( via the " ask a question " button up top , not by leaving a comment on this answer ) . i am not trying to turn this answer into a repository for every possible cheat and tweak . the purpose was to explain to you how you get to the point where you enter these commands in the first place . can i use this with multiplayer ? i do not recommend you use this with multiplayer ! yes , i said this already . it was worth saying twice . i have seen rumors that ea might block/ban players who are using a tweaked file , since they could use it to cheat . i am trying to get a definite answer on if non-cheating tweaks will be a problem , but for now , better safe than sorry .
no , you cannot be named guildmaster until you resolve your unfinished business with nocturnal . benefits of being named guild master include a tribute chest full of ( respawning ! ) loot , the guild master armor ( an improved version of the thieves guild armor you were issued on joining , and a perk giving +25% armor rating when wearing a full set of guild armor .
you have to guess and employ a process of elimination when you are experiencing a " translator malfunction . " sometimes it is easy : if the instruction is on your screen but specifies a number or action that does not appear on any of your untranslated panels , you know it is not yours and it is up to the other team members to figure it out . if you are hearing the instruction from a team member , it might be your panel . does a number or action match ? ( "engaging " usually matches toggle switches . ) the only sure way to figure it out is to try something and notice whether it clears the instruction or not . this is obviously hard when it is not your panel , but that is why you have to work as a team !
use the pipette . it'll remain in the pipette for re-use later ( or for any other forestry machine e.g. the biogasengine ) . the display of the pipette is a little bit buggy though . but - it is a pain in the ass because you need one pipette for every type of liquid . i prefer using a carpenter for each type of liquid . the third way should be pumping the liquid out using liquid pipes - but i have not tried that .
with respect to targeting this achievement , there is not a huge amount of difference between the classes . the one thing that may significantly impact your quest for this achievement is the fact that if your buddy dies , if you can revive them before the end of the fight , you are still on track for the achievement . what that means is that you may want to build your character and select skills in such a way as to minimize your use of debuffs or damage over time effects . ( this has the side effect , incidentally , of making much of the game much , much , harder , for what it is worth , so i am not sure i recommend going all in on the strategy - easier to reload , imo . ) this will allow you to make combat a bit more predictable , at the expense of it lasting longer . incidentally , the class best suited to avoiding the application of dot 's - the fighter - is also the class with access to the widest variety of abilities that can lower your opponents attack , which is also useful for pursuing this achievement . another option is to focus more on preventing foes from acting . in this case , the mage has access to a stun from right near the beginning of the game , and later , gains access to the only innate slow effect - which can be very useful . finally , the jew and thief both have access to abilities that can apply ' pissed off ' to targets ; this functions as a taunt of sorts , forcing enemies to attack your character instead of your buddy . ( do note , however , that the jew gains access to this at a much lower level than the thief ) . really though , all of these differences are pretty minor . what matters more is your consumable use , and willingness to reload if things do go a little pear shaped . every class has the ability to do lots of damage , and once you get to a high enough level to kill a mob in one attack , ( the sucker punch perk helps ) the swat helmet and some smart use of your ' shoot ' skill on the map will mean that you can end many fights before an enemy even has a chance to try to hit your buddy .
the easiest way to accomplish this would be to follow these steps : obtain a rocket launcher . jump and shoot directly behind you , downwards at a 45° angle as soon as you fire , face forward and hold d while slowly moving your mouse to the right . do not press w . enjoy the splendor of air strafing to the right the trick with this one that requires practice is facing forward after shooting a rocket behind you . it is a fine art , but then again the entire practice of rocket jumping requires finesse .
you can get an alternate ending and start a new cycle by losing to axel in any of his fights , the first one being in stage 1-4 .
i tested this today . here were our findings : the host controls which missions are available or not . ( enemy and weapon levels are based on the zone . ) however , those missions can be accomplished by anyone in the host 's game . once completed , that mission is completed for all participating characters , even if they were not normally able to complete the mission because they had not progressed that far in the game in single player yet . all participating players receive the same xp , rewards , and mission completions for their character . in other words , if you run with someone who is further ahead in the plot then you , when you leave and go back to your own game ( not on the host 's co-op server ) , then you will see any missions completed during that time with the first host , even if you have not got to that point in the game yet . then , once you get to those missions that you completed on another host 's game , since the missions are already complete for you , you can just go on to the next , uncompleted mission as normal . as a host , the game progress is the same as if you were playing single player . the exception to all of this is for the story missions . you can complete them with the host , but when you go back to your own , non-host , instance , you will still be at your last uncompleted story mission if there was a gap in between the story missions you completed with the host . update : once you catch up to completed story missions , you get a dialog asking if you had like to ' fast forward ' , skipping missions you have already completed in other sessions : so yes , in my opinion , they " fixed " the ineligible mission message from the first borderlands . update : if you complete a mission , then go back either on your own in single player or as the host , after having already completed it previously in a previous session , you get a message in the reward screen saying something along the lines of ' you have already completed the mission and received your reward ' and then do not get the xp or item again — because you already got it the first time you completed it . playing through in vault hunter mode does not count against this repeat reward limit though ; missions there can be completed once more of course before you would get this message again in vhm .
if construction has not started , you can pick up the scaffolding and place it somewhere else . if the building has been built , the easiest way to remove it is to burn it down completely . drop a fireball on the building ( it is the safest way to set it on fire ) and wait . this may take a few attempts as villagers will often try to extinguish it . try not to hit too many of them . the megablast miracle can completely remove any building if you have access to it .
48 minutes real time , which equals one day in game . the timer also continues running when you play singleplayer or go offline .
no , you cannot get banned for changing anything in the settings . ini file . but do back it up in case you make your game unplayable . bfbc2 can be played with different height ratio , so the fov in the settings is the vertical fov , so use this fov calculator to figure out the horizontal fov if you want to set it to something specific horizontal .
jason lee was a ( quite legendary ) professional skateboarder long before he was ever in my name is earl . he is saying ' git git yeah ' , and it does not mean anything at all . . in fact , it is pretty annoying .
after some experimentation , i guessed it was because the game was trying to show me too many things on the turn transition - so what i did was to change to strategic view ( f10 ) just before clicking " next turn " , then the transition was quick and i was able to reach the next turn without crashing . i then changed back from strategic to normal view . i did not have to do it in subsequent turns , passing that turn everything seemed to go back to normal .
no , the ether shield cannot be found in the game outside of the points when it is equipped to phoebe . it is identical in fashion to the body armors that all four companions have that likewise cannot be found . all of benjamin 's equipment comes as a set of three , which is also how it is rendered in the equipment screen . there is not room for a fourth shield . i would imagine that the placement of the shield in both the shield section and in the other character armor section is just an odd choice from the writer of that particular guide .
what i am more curious about is how does zachary comstock enter booker dewitt 's world . if the two worlds in which booker/comstock exists are completely separate , how did one get into the other ? " one man goes into the waters of baptism . a different man comes out , born again . but who is that man who lies submerged ? perhaps that swimmer is both sinner and saint , until he is revealed unto the eyes of man . " – zachary hale comstock , " everyman , all at once " " a young booker participates in the massacre at wounded knee and is tramautized by the experience . booker considers baptism as a means of escaping his sin . in one universe . . . booker refuses , believing that a baptism cannot erase sin . in another universe . . . booker accepts the baptism and is ' born again ' as comstock . the crucial split occurs here . comstock and booker both reflect on their actions at wounded knee ( though nobody remembers comstock being there since he assumed a new identity , comstock reflects on his time at wounded knee in one of his voxophone voice records ) . " * the baptized booker dewitt ( now known as comstock ) has funded rosalind lutece 's ( whose research allowed for technology that makes columbia fly ) research of lutece fields ( which led to the tears ) , which is how he gleaned through other worlds and where he got his " prophecies " . the tears made him sterile and grow prematurely old . this is why comstock looks way older than unbaptized booker , even though they should have been the same age , which is 38 during most of the events of the game ) . from his " prophecies " he learned that " it is his ' seed ' that will essentially bring about the next apocalypse by raining fire on the land below and having columbia serve as the next ' ark'" . * this made comstock hatch a plan to take his alternate universe counterpart 's ( unbaptized booker dewitt ) baby ( anna/elizabeth ) and groom her to be his successor , with the assistance of and using the technology ( tears ) made by rosalind lutece . comstock and rosalind lutece was assisted by rosalind lutece 's alternate universe counterpart , robert lutece ( same universe as unbaptized booker dewitt ) , who has been able to communicate with rosalind lutece by communicating through " lutece fields " , which he also discovered in his universe . booker dewitt ( unbaptized ) feeling guilty about the events of the wounded knee massacre , dealt with his guilt by gambling . he then built up a huge debt to " people one would not want to owe money to " . to forward comstock 's plan , robert lutece approached booker dewitt claiming that he will " wipe away the debt " if booker sold his baby ( anna ) to comstock . booker dewitt realizes/remembers in the end of the game that it was robert lutece who asked him to " bring us the girl and wipe away the debt " . booker dewitt agreed to the terms and gave up anna to comstock . ( comstock traveled through a tear to get anna . ) however , booker tried to stop comstock from taking anna in the last minute , but failed to do so . more info regarding this event here : how did elizabeth lose her small finger ? why is there a reference to rapture , from bioshock 1 ? " rapture story is a variable of this story in an alternative universe , but they are not the same people and not in the same time ( by the way , that would put andrew ryan in his 90 's during the events of the first game , which obviously is not true ) . elizabeth said there is always a man and always a city , but she did not say it was always the same man and city . there are an infinite number of possible variations of men and cities , each with their own infinite variations . that is the multiverse theory : infinite worlds with infinite possibilities . " source : comment at reddit /r/bioshock post , " my detailed ending explanation . my attempt at the most accurate ending explanation/discussion . [ ultimate spoilers ] " by reddit user , brokenbirthday " andrew ryan is related to comstock in a universe that plays out with different ' variables': throughout bioshock , the bathyspheres are used by jack as a mode of transportation to travel around rapture and its ' abandoned ' city sections . it is revealed that jack can use the bathyspheres only because his genetic signature is close enough to ryan 's that the security system does not deny him access . sullivan clearly states this in one of his audio diaries ' sisters , cousins — anyone in the ballpark genetically will be able to come and go as they see fit . ' --- booker is able to use the bathysphere to reach the surface . this occurs after the civil war when genetic restrictions on bathysphere travel were put in place to stop rebels/dissidents from escaping . " * " elizabeth needed a place to destroy songbird , and the best place would be deep underwater , where he would not be able to survive under immense pressure . this is seen in many of fink 's blueprints concerning songbird and songbird 's reaction to water , seen the first time he attacks you when you and elizabeth crash into battleship bay . another reason is to tie columbia and rapture thematically . rapture , like columbia , is very much a dystopia , and the game bioshock holds many similarities with bioshock infinite . this suggests that rapture is an alternate dimension of columbia . this is further exemplified when elizabeth mentions ' there is always a lighthouse , there is always a city , there is always a man"' pointing to the main thematic similarities between both cities , and the overarching themes of the series and possible future iterations of the series . " source : reddit /r/bioshock post , " bioshock infinite : the ultimate spoiler faq " by reddit user , awchern there had to be a reason why zachary comstock did not want booker dewitt to capture elizabeth ; he had to label booker as a false prophet . was this to keep their society alive ( if booker showed elizabeth the " truth " , would everything they created cease to exist ) ? " it is one thing to imagine one 's future , and another to see it . i have seen the seeds of fire that will prepare the sodom below for the coming of the lord . but elizabeth shall sow those seeds , not i . i will fall before the job is done . . . but she shall take up my mantle . the lord is calling me home . i feel his love in every tumor , because they are the train which takes me to his station . and i go with joy , knowing that elizabeth will take my earthly place . but the false shepherd is coming to lead my lamb astray . i will not board that train until she is safe from his deceptions . " – zachary hale comstock , " a reward , deferred " " and the lord saw the wickedness of man was great . and he repented he had made man on the earth . " rain ! forty days and forty nights of the stuff . and he left not a thing that walked alive . you see , my friends , even god is entitled to a do-over . and what is columbia if not another ark , for another time ? " – zachary hale comstock , " another ark for another time " comstock has received " a prophecy that it is his ' seed ' that will essentially bring about the next apocalypse by raining fire on the land below and having columbia serve as the next ' ark'" . * booker dewitt has seen this event in a dream ( new york in flames ) and has actually seen it when an older elizabeth ( from an alternate universe where booker failed to rescue her ) showed it to him . the older elizabeth in that alternate universe was broken by prolonged capture and hopelessness because booker failed to rescue her , that she gave in to that universe 's comstock 's indoctrination . comstock does not want booker to stop this " prophecy " of his from happening . what exactly happens in the ending ? this bioshock infinite timeline posted in the reddit /r/bioshock subreddit by reddit user , haettenschweiler , gives a great explanation of that : ( click on image preview below to view complete , original-size image ) other questions with answers where the ending is expounded upon are : how does the ending fix anything ? what was up with the coin flip question ? how is the after credits scene possible ?

yes , it is possible to re-launch him into the play area , thus getting him a " second chance " . i have not played this game in about 12 years , but i believe the launch mechanic acts like a spring board - wait for a bit after he lands on the board , then hit a when the platform 's descent slows down . trying to re-launch him as soon as he hits the board will not work . you can actually save kirby through this method multiple times per lives , as long as you get the timing right . it becomes increasingly harder ( per life ) every time you successfully save yourself , because the platform actually decreases in size . below is a video of someone executing this correctly in their game :
endermen take damage from water . so : surround your house with a moat . as long as every floor tile on the same side of the moat as your house is sufficiently illuminated ( i.e. . , within 7 blocks of a torch , 8 blocks of glowstone , close to burning netherrack , etc . ) , endermen should not be able to get to your house to disassemble it . bear in mind that , generally , the roof of your house is probably also a valid place for endermen to spawn—put torches up there , too ! note that lava is also an effective deterrent , but it will also destroy any dropped items from enemies . update ( october 3 , 2012 ) : a mere moat is no longer sufficient . my current strategy for preventing harassment by endermen to build my house with a diagonally sloping roof and put a water source block at the uppermost point , completely submerging my house in running water ; the interior contains only a nether portal in waist-deep water . the nether portal emerges into an enclosed tunnel that spirals down into the depths of the nether and is heavily illuminated , where a second portal returns you to the real world in my actual subterranean home .

before getting to the answer , there is a bit of relevant background information - namely , there is a difference between digimon families/species and digimon elements . families : every digimon in the game is part of a family . the 8 family types are as follows : holy demon plant/insect machine beast dragon water/aquatic bird this is a trait that you as a player can know upon encountering different digimon . this will not differ between the same species of digimon ( for example , all chicchimon will be part of the holy family ) elements : every attack has an element type . there are also 8 of these : holy dark electric steel earth air water fire digimon of the same family will usually use that type of element to attack : holy family typically uses holy element attacks demon family typically uses dark element attacks plant/insect will typically use electric element attacks machine family will typically use steel element attacks beast family will typically use earth element attacks dragon family will typically use fire element attacks water family will typically use water element attacks bird family will typically use air type attacks every digimon has an elemental weakness , though it varies by individual digimon . a total list for all digimon , including species/family , strengths , and weaknesses can be found here however , regarding specific elemental attack type weaknesses , according to this thread , every digimon : has a hidden resistance status for each element , the lowest value is their " weakness " and the highest one their " resistant " one . obviously hitting something with something it is weak against deals more damage . so , although you can know a specific digimon 's type weakness ( from the total list of all digimon above ) , the remainder type weaknesses are hidden . nevertheless , all of these hidden values can be buffed using farm items , though i believe that they still remain hidden . the only way that comes to mind to test a specific digimon 's other weaknesses would be trial and error . i would suggest keeping an eye out for attack types that are very effective against your specific digimon , and then buffing that resistance with a farm item .

i think the following is the correct way to currently do what i wanted : ensure that steam thinks the game is not installed . close steam just to be sure . copy the game files to SteamApps\common\&lt;game_name&gt; , where &lt;game_name&gt; is to be found out via googling/equivalent . in my specific instance , this was Batman Arkham City GOTY . launch steam and install the game . the installation will go through a " discovering existing files for _" stage . watch and wait as it downloads only the missing parts . i still have to download 9.8 gb though ( instead of 17 ) in my specific case .

there is actually a host of factors that influence the outcome of this interaction . what it comes down to is whether the survivor trusts you . whether you have built up enough trust with them will determine whether they will believe you outright when you confront them , require a hard , or possibly even max level charm/intimidation check to persuade ( this appears to be what happened to you , but sadly , you do not have enough paragon/renegade points to make it through ) , or if you have been truly neglectful and/or hostile , they may be unable to be swayed . these factors include : whether you saved the council in the original mass effect whether you pursued a romance with them in the original mass effect your response in conversations on mars regarding your prior work with cerberus , and whether you can be trusted . how many times you visited them in the hospital between missions , and your gift , if applicable . if you romanced them in me1 , whether you pursued a different romance in me2 if you did , whether you were honest and/or apologetic about that alternative romance . your use of paragon or renegade interrupts in the final conversation . if major kirrahe or thane krios survived the first two games and saved the salarian counselor . if the salarian died , udina will show doctored footage implicating you , which makes the whole interaction much more difficult .

seems there is no reliable and reproducible way of getting past this . i did it on multiple occasions , where i threw things around and snuck past the guards behind their backs , the whole time crouching . they sometimes detected me , and at other times just minded their own business . at one time i took the left corridor , threw a small glass item to the right when i reached the mid part , then sprinted off to the finish . so stealth is not the only option here , and i think that is the message the game wants to deliver : there are always options .
each stat has a particular type of rune that it is best with . even if it is available on other runes , it will only have a weaker effect in comparison . you can see the full list of these compatibilities in this answer . generally , it is optimal to go for these " primary " runes , but a certain strategies do revolve around using " secondary " rune types . the " halo " effect shows you what the primary rune type for that particular stat is . so for example , if you have a greater glyph of strength , it will have a red halo , because the best rune type for attack damage is the mark ( red ) . seals of strength would also have a red halo . quintessences will always glow the color of one of the other three runes unless it is one of the stats that is only available on a quintessence . so a quintessence of fortitude will glow yellow as health is generally a seal . but a quintessence of swiftness will glow purple , as movespeed is only available on quintessences .
yes , they can ( tested playing with zer0 , maya , and salvador . ) however , it is usually so quiet that other players can not hear it unless little else is happening and music volume is turned way down .
you have got more than just categories in your library . you also have filters . you can filter the list by games you have installed , by games you have played recently and by games you marked as favorites . if you have played that game recently , you will also find it in steam 's jumplist , or at the top of steam 's tray icon 's context menu . what you really need though is search ; nothing really beats that . you do not even have to use steam for that : if you told steam to , all of your steam games ( except shortcuts ) are added to the start menu . want team fortress 2 ? press the ⊞ win button on your keyboard , type the first letters of the game , press enter and you will have it launched faster than any category or filter combo can .
here is a guide on how to complete the framing frame heist stealthily . i have included videos of each day demonstrating how the execute the plans but remember that each game has a variety of randomised elements which means you have to adapt the plan to your particular spawn . day one mission objective the elephant wants you to frame a senator , you are going to do this by stealing paintings that have just been sold from an art gallery , framing them in frames with cameras fitted into them and selling them to the senator . the art gallery has up to nine paintings marked with red sold stickers stickers , get them . you need to steal at least four paintings . get the paintings from inside the art gallery to a van outside . the plan the art gallery has a total of six guards , one of these guards will remain stationed at the front desk unless alerted , and another will remain in the camera room until you breach it . you will need the following abilities between your crew : at least one crew member with the smoother talker ability , at least one crew member with the dominate ability , at least one crew member with the cleaner ability aced to dispose of bodies , a crew member with the ecm overdrive ability aced to get into the security room a crew member with catburglar is optional for the fall into the room with active lasers it is best to also get the camera feeds asset , and position one of your crew ( that is not responsible for any of the above abilities ) on the camera feeds to help mark the guards . assign another of your crew to scout around on the roof , helping the two breaching the art gallery by marking cameras and guards . one crew member can breach via the roof if you want but my favourite method of cleaning up the guards is to draw them towards the bathroom at the front of the art gallery ( there is a pickable door outside on the way up to the roof ) by activating the hand dryers . this allows you to pick off the first four guards one at a time without drawing too much attention to yourself . bag these up and hide them in one of the cubicles . spot the camera in the first hall from the roof before running in , and start clearing up paintings . throw the paintings up to the spotter on the roof and he can throw them over towards the van . move from room to room , spotting the cameras from the roof first until you reach the room that is blocked off by lasers and then exit the building . normally by this point you have enough paintings to fulfil the objective but if you want or need more you can have one of your crew members breach the last room from the roof while the two of your crew move the paintings to the van . the spotter on the roof remains in position to catch paintings . to exit , kill the guard and quickly run over to the van before the pager times out ( the sprinter ability is good for this ) and you will get out without an escape . if all goes well , you will be in and out without triggering an alarm and you will get an achievement - painting yourself into a corner . here is a video of day one being stealthed : day two mission objective get the paintings to the buyer , get the cash to the van . the plan the plan is simple - get the paintings out of the back of your van , into a train car nearby that has a ringing phone in it . answer the phone to start the deal with the buyer and he will request that you all get into the train car and throw the paintings out through the roof . for each painting delivered , you will get a bag of cash . do not throw the last painting out until you have got all of the bags of cash over to the door at the far end of the train car as doing so will start the next section of the mission . get the cash out of the train car and head towards the getaway van - ensuring that any civilians who see you are controlled quickly , or several ecm jammers are used to stop anybody phoning the police . if you happen to get all nine paintings on day one , you will get an achievement once you have completed trading the bags - big deal . here is a video of day two being almost stealthed : day three mission objective the objective of day three is to break into the senator 's house , steal five of his personal gadgets that can be used to gain access to his desktop computer , use the computer to gain access to the vault , plant cocaine in the vault and ( optionally ) steal all of the gold . the paintings you stole on day one have been fitted with cameras , which can be viewed using a laptop on the roof . during the first stage of the heist you will want one of your crew members watching these cameras constantly , marking guards and locating the senator 's gadgets . the plan you are going to break into the senator 's house , take out the first four guards and answer their pagers - dispose of the bags on the roof near the start so that nobody will find them . the fifth guard will need shouting down . you can mix this up a bit - if you get an opportunity to shout down a guard in a part of the house that nobody else is going to go , or within a timeframe where the other guards will not be a problem , then do so . you will need the following abilities between your crew : at least one crew member with the smoother talker ability , at least one crew member with the cleaner ability aced to dispose of bodies , at least one crew member with the dominate ability there is not a security room in the house so you can not directly take control of the house cameras . you can , however , melee them to break them and clear yourself a path to the vault . find the five gadgets and take them to the laptop on the roof , which will allow bain to unlock the desktop computer in the office upstairs . at this point you will need to assign a crew member to use the computer , as it is used to open the vault and also temporarily disable the lasers in the vault . once the vault is open , you will need to turn off the lasers with the desktop computer - these will only stay off for around 15 seconds but they will beep several times before reactivating . once you have got the gold out to the vault it should be a simple case of transporting it all to the exit point on the roof . if all goes well , you will be in and out without triggering an alarm and you will get an achievement - i was not even there ! here is a video of day three being stealthed :
i played through the harley dlc twice an noticed this , at the time i was confused but it climbed up to 100% when i completed it the second time and then to test what i suspected was going on i restarted a 3rd time and the percentage reset again . so i am pretty sure it displays the percentage of your current saved play through .
no , neither one of these actions actually have a practical purpose . they are there just to add to the flavor and atmosphere of the game . to note , the humming does change when you do it with different tracks in the game , so if you enjoy the music , it is worth it to do when the music changes if you want to hear what it sounds like when red hums along . this can be fun to do after you gain access to the sandbox via the backdoors , which has a jukebox in it . you can then flip through various songs at your leisure to listen to her hum .
yes , the level of light that you are currently standing in affects how easily you are spotted while sneaking . see the wiki entry on sneaking for more information . as for how much it affects you , it only comes into play for visual identification , so you can sneak up on someone in pure daylight if you are approaching silently from behind , but they will be able to spot you from much further away if they are looking at you .
basically , one can get armor/weapons up to : full daedric armor : 2125 armor daedric bow : 562 damage daedric dagger : 171 damage daedric two handed sword : 605 damage daedric one handed sword : 518 damage perks you need ( 33 perks ) : heavy armor ( juggernaut 5 , well fitted , tower of strength , matching set ) 5 weapon perks ( base , damage raising ) of your choice smithing ( steel , dwarven , orcish , ebony , daedric ) enchanting ( 5 x enchanter , insighful , corpus , extra effect ) alchemy ( 5 x alchemy , physician , benefactor ) instructions : get max perks and 100 in each skill . enchant fortify alchemy helm , ring , gloves + necklace . the buff should be +25 on each for + 100 total . put on the gear and make 4 fortify enchant potions ( + 27ish ? ) use those potions to make better fortify alchemy gear . note : you have to be quick because you only have 30 seconds per potion . use that gear to make better fortify enchanting potions . keep repeating 4 - 5 until you can make fortify alchemy + 29 on each piece ( 116 total ) use 4 +32 enchanting pots to create fortify smithing rings , neck , gloves and chest . make some fortify smithing potions ( +130% with your alchemy gear ) craft daedric armor , shield and weapon . put on your smithing gear , drink the potion ( 130 + 116 = +246% to smithing ) , then improve your weapons . make about 10 enchanting potions ( +32 ) enchant a ring gloves and neck with fortify heavy armor and fortify one handed . ( i believe the number was 29 for armor 47% for weapon ? not in front of computer ) . enchant health / heavy armor to chest . enchant one handed / stamina to boots . enchant helm with whatever you want . source
very odd - i found the wedding ring on the witch myself , so it does sound like a glitch . unfortunately as an xbox user you can not abuse the console into solving the problem . if i remember correctly if your speech is high enough , you should be able to persuade/intimidate ysolda into telling you the next location for the quest . this looks to be your only option if you do not want to pay .
it turns out that the p2p download is slow and inefficient with few players seeding . i resorted to the http download , and finally patched the game via an ethernet connection . it was still very slow , but it finally downloaded after an extensive amount of time . there appears to be approximately 1000 players online still .
turns out that the way to airdash is to dodge ( attack + jump buttons/keys together ) in midair !
you need to define a burrow for the safe zone , and a civilian alert that restricts movement to it . to create the burrow press w to go to the burrows screen press a to add a new burrow size the burrow ( remember , a burrow is 3d ) choose a name , color , etc to create a new alert press m to go to the military screen press a to go to the alerts screen press c to create a new alert name it with n change the burrow restriction by pressing enter on the burrow while the burrow is highlighted . if you have a more complicated burrow setup you can add multiple burrows to an alert . to activate the alert ( as the civilian alert ) press enter while the alert is highlighted . see also : military interface scheduling
valve recently added the function so that it is possible to earn achievements in offline mode . they did not announce it , though , for some reason . one can only speculate about this . the condition for this to work is that , while online , you have run the game once or viewed the details in your library . otherwise steam would not " know " that there are achievements in the first place . source : http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=29035241
you can try recovering the save games ( which are located on C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\savegames on windows 8 ) using a program like recuva . this allows you to find back deleted files and recover them . this will have less success each time you download/install something new on your computer . good luck !
you do not need to do either the meld or the main tutorial . meld is basically explained in game regardless of whether you do the tutorial , and the main tutorial is the same as it was before .
i have both myself and i find that my non-microsoft battery actually lasts longer than the ms one , albeit , it does not seem to be of the same quality . however , you may come across the same problem i have had with unbranded ones , where the dashboard shows the wrong battery level . there has been several occasions where my dashboard has shown the battery as full , but the controller was flashing with the low battery pattern . overall , i think it may entirely be down to the brand of non-microsoft battery , as there is generally wildy varied results . but for consistency and best overall result , the microsoft batteries are far superior . i also have a charging station that charges the ms batteries perfectly well , so it may be worth bearing in mind that it could be the charging station with the issue and not the batteries themselves .
forgive me for the quality of this answer i am on the road . unlike a lot of people i really feel that using drones for defense as zerg is a completely legitimate strategy . zerg is very much a momentum race , so many top players strategy revolves around : power drones and build units at the last possible second . unlike terran or protoss , zerg can produce a very large army very quickly so i feel using your drones to delay is a fairly legitimate strategy . however , i dislike opinions , even my own , so let 's see this strategy in practice : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnmo6n5nmps#t=2m28s this first video is from a pair of plat level players . you will notice that by pulling drones off the mineral line he is able to get a very easy surround ( which whoever this caster is does not seem to understand ) and really take them apart with few losses ( believe he loses 3 drones ) . this delays the 10 pool long enough for his spine crawler to get up and really defend him well . the key point i want you to take away here is : drones can do damage http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggp8gp-radk#t=2m35s this next video shows a zerg defending against a 2 gate back in beta ( when zealots were 5 seconds faster ) . the zerg player here completely misses on his scouting . notice how the zealots are forced back every time he pulls all his dones , but when he only sends in a few ( or the queen alone ) he gets eaten apart . drones are only really strong in numbers and when they can get a surround ( much like zerglings ) . the thing he does do well is sending his drones back to mine every time the zealots back off . this is the second key point : if you are not fighting , you need to be mining . pulling drones is fine , but do not leave them lying around http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghqyxm1gyaw#t=2m15s this third video is a little more high level . i actually saw this match live and blizzcon and the experience was exhilarating . cool here is defending an early bunker rush by boxer . he immediately pulls 3 drones ( 1 from scouting ) to take out the bunker . boxer shows some impressive micro and manages to get the bunker up and a reaper inside . . . just in time to get destroyed by zerglings . this is the third main point : drones are delaying tactic , you are using them to stall until real units can get out . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cogvuquseum#t=1m33 this last video is your money video because its exactly what you are dealing with : 7 pool into spine crawler rush . we see here that the defending player really shows knowledge of all the principles we talked about . when he sees the spine crawlers he pulls a large amount of drones off the mineral line , forcing repeated cancels ( every cancel costs 25 minerals ) . next when zerglings come he uses the mineral trick and then backs out into the open to get a good surround on them and really take them down quickly . finally , all of his actions are a delaying tactic so he can get his zerglings out . so what have we learned : drones can do damage . try to get a good surround , preferably out in the open where he can not use buildings to block you when you are not fighting , you need to be mining . when your zerglings finally pop and you start winning you need to back off and secure your economy drones are a delaying action . zerg is a momentum race and you are just using your drones to delay until you have enough momentum to win . faq but tzenes , what if he just backs off and powers drones and has a larger economy than me ? Omnes non possunt omnis . to pull off this rush he is making a large sacrifice , this means you have a lot of room to breath . worry less about him backing off and more about repelling the rush . by the same token , as soon as the rush is countered , stop producing zerglings . chances are he can not afford a second rush , so building a lot of units here is just letting him catch up .
it is safe to leave the clone bay unpowered . if it can save a crew member after an event , it will . the cloning effect from events behaves like any blue event- it only checks the presence or absence of a system . whether it is powered/damaged/on fire is irrelevant .
what i try to do ( in a short period of time so it does not always happen :p ) : drop hellbats onto the largest concentration of drones/probes/scvs ( save boost ) . select both hellbats . press ' h ' for hold position ( mainly against zerg , so the hellbats do not go chasing queens ) . when the other player pulls all of his workers somewhere else , pick up your hellbats into the medivac , then boost over to where the workers are pooled now ( this is why i recommend saving boost from step 1 ) . repeat if you can , but it may be time to leave ( either save everything or maybe just save medivac and get a few more kills with hellbats ) . notes : the medivac is the most important unit , and i recommend saving the medivac at all costs ( i often sacrifice hellbats since they are cheaper than the medivac , and rally over some new hellbats to drop back in ) . in the early game , well positioned hellbats with a medivas healing overhead can take on almost any unit in small numbers . especially against zerg : look to position your hellbats amongst the minerals so the zerg cannot surround you . against p and t , if the other play does not target down the medivac than you will be able to stay and fight for a couple extra seconds . if you have good multitasking abilities : loading up another medivac and dropping the other player 's natural while your first medivac and hellbats are still alive and harassing the main . one last thing : while you are doing all of this terrific harassment , do not forget to macro up back home ! ! it is great to kill off 10 of the other player 's workers , but if you have not been building your own workers the whole time then you are not going to be as far ahead as you would like . macro macro macro ! edit : another note : if you pull out of your opponents base after doing some damage ( and you still have a hellbat or two ) , it is best to drop the hellbats from your medivac , so that they can be healed before you go back into your opponent 's base . if you simply pull your medivac away ( with hellbats in it ) , they will not be brought back to full health , and will not be as effective when you go to drop them again . edit 2: blizzard is releasing a patch which is reducing the hellbat damage : attack damage decreased from 18 +12 vs . light to 18 . the infernal pre-igniter upgrade increases attack damage from 18 to 18 +12 vs . light .
there does not seem to be any official way . then again , modding the game by splaying open and modifying the internals of the . jar file was never really officially supported , either . the new launcher is , ultimately , part of a rather large series of changes to minecraft , including making mods actually something the game supports via the new resource pack stuff , but until that time , modding is a bit more awkward . however , there is still a way to do it . go into the versions folder inside .minecraft , and copy the version you want to mod . rename the copied folder , and both the files inside , to some new name , say " modded 1 . blah " . lastly , open the . json file in a text editor , and change the line that will read something like "id": "1.6.1", so that the id matches the new name . the new launcher should now show a version " modded 1 . blah " in the list , but since that version does not exist on the minecraft servers , it will not get overwritten . splay open and tinker with the . jar file in there the same way you always would with the old launcher . note : if you are using the new launcher with an older version of minecraft , then the mods you are using may attempt to access files in the bin folder directly . if this is the case , you can simply create a folder named ' bin ' in the . minecraft folder where they are looking for it , and add the files the mod needs in there . the mod should find the files , and carry on as it used to , not knowing the difference .

i have successfully used an app called ds3 tool to use a ps3 controller on windows 7 64 bit . i did do it by cable though , it does also apparently work with bluetooth . it was a bit of a hassle to get setup , but once it worked allowed a lot of customization and worked very well . just follow the setup instructions closely .
you have to enter the freezer and crawl through it , the whole thing . which is a challenge in itself . to start with , you will be working your way from right to left behind each freezer door , until you come to a row of shelves . you will want to slip one foot onto a shelf , then lift the other over the top shelf , then slide the other foot through to the other side . then you will need to slip through the empty shelf , which the game will help you out with by making your body go limp while crawling through it . this will then lift you into an air vent , which should take you right to the frozen pizza .
you cannot remove mods and sell them to other players . once you remove the mod the item and mod becomes bound to you and then the only person that you can sell the weapon/armor/mod to is a vendor . if you are talking about removing the mod just to sell , the cost of removing it is greater than the cost of the mod itself when sold to a vendor .
we kinda/sorta covered this in a couple of questions , but neither seem clear enough to be duplicates : can you run an installed xbox 360 game off of usb flash drives now ? how do i partition my hdd for use on an xbox 360 ? the answer to your particular situation is " kind of . " you can certainly hook up a 1tb hard drive via usb 2.0 . the gotchas are : the xbox 360 does not support usb 3.0 the xbox 360 only allows for 32gb of useful storage per usb device to put that 32gb limit into perspective , downloaded games can range from 500mb to upwards of 5gb , depending on the game . you can also install games from disc onto the hard drive or external usb storage , and those tend to run around 6gb per disc installed , give or take . however , if you plan on using this terabyte drive exclusively for xbox 360 content , most of it is going to go to waste . it seems like microsoft 's intent with adding usb storage support was to replace the old xbox 360 " memory card " with the option for using a usb flash drive , as they hint at in the faq section of this help page . these issues may drive you to purchase an " internal " xbox 360 hard drive , which i believe uses sata ( instead of usb ) and is not limited to 32gb .
crime is generally localized to the hold you are in : if you are kill-on-sight in one hold , running to the next hold over should cause the guards to drop pursuit without new guards joining the chase . however , in general , you should always be able to pay the guards , even if they decide to attack you . as soon as they do , sheathe your weapons/spells/shields and hope they trigger the dialogue to allow you to go to jail or pay off your bounty . if they do not , there are a few things you can try to do : as bri and roughneckrage mention , sometimes all you need is time . wait out a few days and see if the situation has not died down by then . the guards will still want you to make reparations , though . an anonymous user mentions that you can try sneaking up to a guard from behind and trigger the dialogue screen to pay off your bounty . stof mentions another possible thing , the bounty collector . the uesp suggests it is not guaranteed , but if he does visit you , you can pay off your bounty for a 20% premium ( and even keep your stolen items ! ) .
nope , the only control you have is you can choose where it is summoned to when you cast the spell ( by pointing at the location ) . after that point , it will do it is own thing for 60 seconds without your involvement . it will follow you around until it sees something hostile , and then it will attack whatever target it chooses to until the spell ends , it dies , or there is nothing more to attack .
so i do not know of any specifics related to coop ( as compared to pvp ) , but i do know that riot recently changed their formula . if i understand the new formula correctly , there should be no difference between pvp and pve ip/xp gains on a per game basis ( obvious caps still apply ) . previously , the system was based around providing ip in comparison to the 20minute mark ( also known as the surrender minimum time ) . as you played towards that mark you gained more ip/xp and after that mark , these gains rapidly diminished . to help explain this , let 's take the following sample : i play a pvp against grace note and she beats me 25 minutes in . she gets about 115 ip ( plus a bonus ) for winning and i get about 65 for losing . now , let 's say we play again and again she wins , but this time it takes her 45 minutes to woop my butt . i would get 72 ip for hanging in longer , but she would only get 100ip ! obviously the goal here was to penalize longer wins and shorter losses . unfortunately , this encourages farming games , where teams agree to surrender at the 20 minute mark . so riot changed that formula to a new one . here 's your tl ; dr : ip/xp scales with time for those concerned about endless games , the formula is essentially linear up till the 55 minute mark . additionally , both winners and losers scale up with time ( meaning you are no longer penalized for a long win ) . there is also an extra flat bonus for playing the game which does not scale . finally , they have also removed the bonus for non-leaver streaks ( in preference to the new judgement system . for more information on the new system you can read here . also , pictures ! post script for those unaware there are also difficulty scaling modifiers for coop vs ai these percentages represent how much of the standard reward is received : summoner level 1-9: beginner : 100% intermediate : 100% summoner level 11-19: beginner : 75% intermediate : 100% summoner level 20-29: beginner : 50% intermediate : 100% summoner level 30: beginner : 25% intermediate : 75%
the mods button is disabled in the mainmenu . lua file . to re-enable this button you will need to navigate to the mainmenu . lua file , open it with a text editor ( like textwrangler ) and comment out line 33 . ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/sid meier's civilization v/assets/UI/FrontEnd/MainMenu.lua assuming you use steam the line is : Controls.ModsButton:SetHide( true ); to comment it out simply add two hyphens like this : -- Controls.ModsButton:SetHide( true ); this should re-enable the mods button on the main menu . some mods work and some do not , it seems rather hit or miss . if you have a xxxx . civ5mod file use something like ez7z to expand the file which will create a folder that you can then put in your mods folder which should be similar to this : ( depending on which version of civil you have ) ~/Library/Application Support/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS/ or ~/Documents/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS/ depending on whether you have changed the setting to use the library instead of documents . note : if you are running os 10.7 ( lion ) then Users/&lt;your_name&gt;/Library/ is hidden in finder . hold the alt key down and select the finder 's go menu . you will see library as one of the options in that menu . note 2: currently , every time you download a new patch for the game it overwrites your mainmenu . lua back to default so you will have to comment out line 33 again .
it has been some time since i played but no i do not believe that there are any solo fights in the second generation . since the main focus of combat is to chain attacks with other members they tend to avoid solo fights .
yes , they are . the easiest way to check this is to find a weapon with a socket , since you can manually add +min and +max enchantements to them . now add a ruby to it ( enhances damage by a certain range ) . you will see the dps go up in the item tooltip . also , it worked the same way in diablo 2 , so it is likely that they simply just left it the way it was .
for ps3 , short answer is no . it will not back up every save you have on your system . when you play a game , you will get a pop up asking you if you wish to back up the game 's save to online storage . also , it does not work for ps1 , ps2 , psp , and mini saves and you have only 1024 mb of space for saves , so depending on how large these saves are , you might not get them all . if your playstation+ subscription lapses , they will also only keep them for 6 months . you can manually select saves you wish to backup , though . on the xmb , navigate to game and then saved data utility ( ps3 ) . at the top will be online storage where you can browse the saves that are currently stored online and delete/restore them . underneath are all your saves . if you press triangle on any of these , it will bring up a side menu . the easiest way to select games you want to backup saves for , is going up to copy multiple , then you check the games you want backed up .
there is currently no way to view your ping while in the game . there have been complaints about this , but that is the way it is at the moment . of course in battlelog you can browse servers by ping , and you can usually assume that if your ping is low to the server it will also be low while in a game on that server .
short of getting a blue post or twitter reply from a blizzard dev or rep , the only way to achieve knowledge was testing , which is what i attempted . these are my findings : general massacre is a bonus that you receive when you kill multiple enemies with a short time in between each killing . the difference between massive blow and massacre is that the deaths resulting in massive blow have to come from one and the same ability , while massacre can be a chain of an arbitrary amount of abiliities . massacre and other bonuses ( such as massive blow , or the one where you have to destroy environmental objects ) can overlap without interfering with each other , but they can not be identical . e.g. if you trigger a massive blow and then stop doing everything , only the massive blow will be registered . however , if you trigger a massive blow and then go on two kill another couple of enemies , you will be able to cause an additional massacre that consists of all kills of the entire sequence . in my tests , it looked like only attacks and kills help to continue the streak - simply being attacked by monsters was not enough and would interrupt the streak . the minimal amount of monsters which need to be killed in order to trigger the bonus seems to be 10 . i have not seen any lower number or at least i can not remember it . maximum time between each single kill before the streak is interrupted this was very hard to test , because it basically came down to doing it a couple of times and guessing . since i could not use a clock to actually measure it ( i had to fight monsters ) , it comes down to my guess : i feel like the maximum time between each kill is around 2 seconds . one second is most definitely too low , and more than two seconds is definitely too high . knowing blizzard , though , it is not unlikely that it is some arbitrary number in between , like 1.7850 seconds . amount of experience rewarded concluding from around 50 or so massacres it looks like the function is linear , or at least approximately linear . this means that the function will look something like  experience = k*monsters + l  where k and l are constants . in words : if killing 10 mobs gives you 80 bonus xp , then killing 20 will give you roughly 160 . the exact amount depends on k and l . l is just the minimum bonus , which i do not know , but guess to be 50 ( from memory ) . also , this means that there is no one-to-one correspondence between amount of kills and experience rewarded . you should be able to easily see this for yourself : killing , for example , 10 monsters will often reward slightly different amounts of experience . k seems to be based on the levels ( relative to your level ) and types of the monsters that you are killing . whether this is because lower-level or lower-health enemies give less xp ( making k depend on the experience awarded by the kills ) , or because blizzard ( rightfully ) thinks doing massacres with lower-level and lower-heath enemies are easier than doing massacres with higher level enemies , i do not know , but the end-result is the same . this gives an important conclusion : k does not seem to directly correlate with your level or strength , or the monsters levels or strengths . instead , it depends only on relative levels or strengths . killing many monsters with level 59 will still not give you ( on average ) more experience per massacre than killing many monsters on level 10 , or more precisely , killing weak enemies on level 59 will not give more experience on average than killing weak enemies on level 10 . how the different inputs from different types and amounts of enemies are put together to form k , and what the exact values for the different enemy types are is something that we can not know until blizzard tells us directly . to summarize it : the amount of xp awarded is not quadratic , exponential , or even something of higher order . this means that the experience awarded will not blow out of proportions if you kill more and more enemies . instead the amount will rise steadily , making two massacres with 10 kills each worth about the same as one massacre with 20 kills ( assuming that you are killing the same monsters ) . massacres with " harder " enemies reward more xp , while not being harder to do , since massacre streaks are not interrupted as long as you are attacking something . since evaluating precise values for all monster types , monster levels and monster amounts is not feasible ( the number of possible combinations is too high to be accurately tested ) , it is unrealistic to give some sort of " kills:experience " table . for the same reason ( too many combinations to be sure until we get official word from blizzard ) , it is possible that i am missing some hidden variables which change the amount of experience awarded . however , these , if existent , should be relatively small in magnitude . since higher difficulties in normal are designed to be tougher , it can be expected that enemey " strength " relative to you will on average be higher than in normal difficulty . this will most likely result in a higher average k across all battles , meaning that massacre kill-streak rewards should on average get higher and higher in each difficulty level , although this is just speculation on my part ( i have not tested it yet ) .
i usually carry invisibility potions with me , use it when you see dragon to get some head start and sprint further he will stop chasing you or you can at least get far away to fast travel , it might be a bad option to fast-travel if you have not discovered any nearby locations to restore your journey .
yes , you can put most things into your inventory , make a new world with the same seed* , and then copy your player.dat** over the new blank one in the new world . that will work for most things , but there are some items/blocks that store data elsewhere than player.dat , like cc computers and ender pouches . the way to find these is pretty much to just dig around in the world save folder . any folder that is not present in a vanilla world save is worth investigating . you can do this incrementally , too : make a safe backup of your old world , create your new world , and then copy things over a piece at a time as you discover them . because you have got a safe backup , you can always go digging for the save data for something when you discover it missing in your new world . * an easy way to recreate a world with the same seed is to just make a new folder manually , copy the level.dat into it , then open the new same-name-different-folder world save that appears in minecraft as a result . it'll regenerate the world and keep all your original settings . ** at some point minecraft switched from using player.dat for single player to using players/[username].dat , so your " player.dat" is probably not actually named player.dat . i believe this was changed when they made it so that singleplayer internally runs a multiplayer server .
the world will just generate with air blocks replacing non-vanilla blocks , and your non-vanilla items will just disappear . re-installing the mod will not bring the blocks or items back , unless you do so before loading the world again . ( as a side note , some mods used to render your world unplayable unless the mod was installed again , i am pretty sure notch fixed it though , but there might be a few that mess things up . )
yes , you can . the same principle applies as when you are on foot , in that you need to be looking in their direction and not have them in your peripheral vision . the same applies to all vehicles .
no , the launch-day version of gta v does not allow saving of outfits in your closet . there is a similar post about this on the gta forums : http://gtaforums.com/topic/569416-savable-outfits/
in the mobile version of terraria , there is no hardmode . you will have to play on the console or pc versions to experience hardmode . source on the console/pc version , to enter hardmode , follow these steps : kill a voodoo demon and take the guide voodoo doll it drops . voodoo demons spawn in the underworld . throw the doll into lava ( in the underworld ) . fight the wall of flesh that you have just spawned . once you have killed the wof , you have just entered hardmode !
it depends . that is really the beauty of unit upgrades , you get to tailor your units to the situation . if you are looking for two upgrades to always take , you are asking the wrong question . ( still a fine question for gaming . stackexchange . it gets the ball rolling . . . ) the right question is what upgrades will be good for this situation ? are there lots of enemies in the city ? go for collateral damage . ( barrage i , ii ) facing lots of melee units ? take anti-melee . ( barrage i , ii ) do you have a massive force besides , and are just trying to take the cities as fast as possible ? go for more bombard damage so you can move on quickly . ( barrage i + accuracy ) are you having trouble with your first few attacks ? go for city attack or first strike . ( city raider i , ii ) ( drill i , ii ) these suggestions apply to all siege weapons , since they are allowed the same upgrades . however , there will be times when you do not know what upgrades will be best . in those cases : take upgrades that you know will at least be useful . faster bombard , and city attack can not be wrong against cities . first strike should be ok against cities , and collateral should be ok against multiple units , but check to see if the enemy units are immune to those first . take a variety of upgrades , and use them as they seem useful , or try each combo and see what works . save the upgrades till the last moment you can . then you will have the most possible info to choose with . good luck !
i found a temporary fix for this , but if anyone has a real answer to the problem , i will select it as answer . world of warcraft i found that changing the game resolution settings either in game or by the configuration file do not actually change the game resolution but my desktop resolution . the result is that most of the game interface is now off screen beyond my reach . if i erase the set resolution line of the configuration file , the game by default goes to my desktop resolution . this is where the solution i found lies . before starting the game , change your desktop resolution . when the game runs in full screen mode , it will match the desktop resolution . this seems like a round-a-bout solution . i found no one with the same problem on wine or on blizzard 's forums ( on their forums its always " we do not support linux so we wont acknowledge your question . please stop mentioning wine , buy windows" ) . this is why i am inclined to believe that there is either another solution . starcraft ii i thought the solution for all newer blizzard games would be the same due to the similarities in the bug . however , the configuration of starcraft ii is a bit different . instead of removing the height and width settings on the variables . txt file in your starcraft 2 , edit them to match your desktop resolution exactly . if it is off by one pixel , it will bug . it is possible that no one really wants to run these new games on old computers that can not handle full hd as well . that would explain why no one else has complained about this problem . i can navigate well through the game menus on this machine , but loading a level takes half an hour and once the level starts it runs close to 0 fps ( the game quoted it at 0 fps ) . edit : the workaround for starcraft ii no longer works . i have yet to find another way to reset the solution under wine .
as of minecraft 1.6.6 , water freezes and snow falls in icy biomes . the top layer of water freezes in icy biomes , even when it is not snowing . water will freeze even above sea level . ( although a development preview video prior to the 1.5 " weather " update appeared to show water freezing , this feature did not work until minecraft 1.6 . ) as of the 1.5 " weather " update , snow periodically falls in icy biomes as it did in old pre-biomes snowy worlds , and will form a layer of snow on the ground .
alternatively , you can stop casting the spell at a higher caster ability . press the c button to lower the mana cost ( and also the effectiveness , but it is worth it ) .
in vehicles , service stars are awarded for scoring the number of points which is equivalent to earning all the unlocks again . it is the same as the kits . here is the exact number for each applicable vehicle : tanks : 100,000 points attack chopper : 60,000 points scout chopper : 48,000 points mobile aa : 32,000 points lav : 90,000 points jets : 35,000 points
i found this list of biotic and tech combos on the bioware forums . biotic combos singularity --> warp , throw , shockwave , charge , nova , cluster grenade , reave stasis --> warp , throw , shockwave , charge , nova , cluster grenade , reave pull --> warp , throw , shockwave , charge , nova , cluster grenade , reave warp --> throw , shockwave , charge , nova , cluster grenade , reave lift grenade --> warp , throw , shockwave , charge , nova , cluster grenade , reave shockwave ( only with rank 6 lifting shockwave evolution ) --> warp , throw , charge , nova , cluster grenade , reave reave --> warp , throw , shockwave , charge , nova , cluster grenade tech combos fire explosion - can be set up by : incinerate , carnage , inferno grenade , incendiary ammo can be detonated with any biotic/tech/combat powers that can deal direct damage ( except for the powers that are used to set up the combo ) . effect : enemies effected by any of the fire based powers , cause an aoe fire explosion , once they are killed by a direct damage power . the effect is similar to blowing up pyros with overload in me2 . note : enemy must be killed by the second power , in order to cause a fire explosion . e.g. it will not work , if an enemy is hit by incinerate --> overload , and still has hp left after that . so , in this case , overload would have to do sufficient damage to outright kill a burning enemy , in order to cause a fire explosion . cryo explosion - can be set up by : cryo blast , cryo ammo can be detonated with any biotic/tech/combat powers that can deal direct damage . effect : frozen enemies killed by damage based powers , cause an aoe cryo explosion , freezing any enemy that is nearby . note : same as fire explosion , frozen enemies must be killed by the second power in order to trigger cryo explosion . tech burst - can be set up by : overload , energy drain , disruptor ammo , sabotage can be detonated by any biotic/tech/combat powers that can deal direct damage ( except for the powers that are used to set up the combo ) . effect : enemies effected by electricity based powers , discharge multiple electricity bolts to nearby enemies , when hit with direct damage powers . effect is similar to overload 's chain overload upgrade . note : unlike fire and cryo explosion combos , this one does not require an enemy to be killed by the second power . e.g. enemy hit by overload --> incinerate will produce tech burst , whether he is killed by incinerate or not .
i wanted to create a flat land multiplayer bukkit server , perfect for building . i was able to . yes , there are saves in %appdata%\roaming . minecraft\saves that you can use . all you need to do is drop it into the server folder after you have createde it and specify the in the server config file ( world_name= ) and write the name of you world .
i have asked the author of the test about the missing songs and after checking again , he now changed the number to five . it seems that in an older version of the import tool there were more songs missing , but in the current version all songs from the original rocksmith disc can be imported , except for : eric clapton - run back to your side cream - sunshine of your love seth chapla - star spangled banner seth chapla - jules chris lee - boss while this information is confirmed for the german version , i cannot guaranteed that there are no differences in other countries , but the list of missing song goes in accordance with the english faq of rocksmith 2014 , that says that . . . . . . " you will be able to import 52 of the original songs into the new rocksmith 2014 edition [ . . . ] except eric clapton " run back to your side " and cream " sunshine of your love " from the main disc tracks , plus 3 of the 5 unlockable bonus songs . " to import the songs from the rocksmith disc , you need to have a save file of the original game on your hard drive . when first starting rocksmith 2014 , you will be asked if you have played rocksmith before , to which you must answer " yes " . on playstation 3 and xbox 360 you will get access to the import tool in the ingame store under the tab " packs " . it does not show up , if you answer the question with " no " . on pc , the import tool can be bought at any time from the steam store . according to the german ubisoft support ( last paragraph ) , if you answered with " no " on the xbox 360 version , you can only get access to the import tool by moving the rocksmith 2014 save file onto a usb or external hard drive . when starting the game without a save file on the hard drive , the question should appear again and you can download the import tool . after that , transfer your save files back . please note that in the ubisoft support entry , this has only been confirmed for xbox 360 , although it is likely to work for the playstation 3 as well . this question has not been answered on the english ubisoft support forum , which is why the link leads to the german one . also , all dlc songs from the original rocksmith can be used in rocksmith 2014 . for the ps3 you can download them from the psn by searching for add-ons for the original rocksmith . the dlc for the original rocksmith does not show up in the add-on list of rocksmith 2014 in the playstation store , but after downloading and installing the songs , they are automatically recognized and added to your song list . you do not need the original rocksmith to play any dlc songs in rocksmith 2014 . this is likely to work the same way on the xbox and pc versions .
you can use teleport , then navigate to the very bottom of the cave . that gives you a valid exit option .
as far as i can determine , this is not a thing that is possible . in order to set up a multiplayer battle maison , the game requires that you and your partner establish a infrared connection . presumably this is to ensure both persons are in the same room and can communicate , because the infrared connection is only used for the initial setup . as after the setup , the 3ds units are no longer required to be pointing at each other .
you can change region before logging in . look into account tab , inside options menu . as you said if you want to change region ( this feature is available when all region has launched the game ) you have to start a fresh character and you cannot do it " on-the-fly " , but you have to exit and re-login .
i am pretty sure p means any punch ( lp , mp , hp ) . i would check to make sure you are inputting the commands you are trying correctly and that you meet the requirements to execute the move ( for example if you have enough meter to do so ) .
they are demon altars which are not monsters - hence you cannot get the tooltip by hovering over them . you use them to craft some ' boss ' summoning materials slime crown , suspicious looking eye and worm food , as well as creating the stronger pre-hard mode weapon night 's edge . demon altars can only be destroyed with pwnhammer or hamdrax after wall of flesh is destroyed . trying to destroy demonic altar before defeating wall of flesh , you will take half your current health in damage minus armor , no matter the tool . pwnhammer is acquired by defeating wall of flesh . destroying a demonic altar will " bless " your world with decreasing amounts of ore , starting with cobalt , then mythril , then adantium and then starting the loop again . this means that it will convert random blocks into whatever ore it is blessing your world with . it will also place ebonstone/pearlstone in random locations underground , allowing corruption/hallow to spread faster and from multiple locations . source : terraria wiki
some of this information will overlap with the previous answer , but as that one does not address your question in full and relies mostly on speculation , i will try to fill those gaps . confirmation on the respawn limit : there are lots of people out there currently debating the relative merits and demerits of the system , so i think the existence of the limit is pretty well established . so far , the consensus seems to be that the limit is approximately 15 deaths/spawns , but this will not be known for certain until the pc version comes out and can be hacked , or until someone actually sits down , does a playthrough , and records all of the data . name of the item which can reset the respawn limit : as @kiilla mentions , this is the bonfire ascetic . which enemies the item will cause to respawn : it will respawn all enemies in the bonfire 's area , including bosses . ( more accurately , it resets the respawn limit on all enemies in the area -- meaning that if you have killed one enemy seven out of fifteen times , it will once again have fifteen lives as well ) . additional effects the item has outside of just respawning enemies : this thread explains it much better and more succinctly than i could . the most important thing to understand is that it is actually making the area one difficulty level higher than it is currently set to ( e . g . , if you are playing on ng , the area will be set to ng+ ) . relevant portion of the thread quoted below . loot on dead bodies is respawned ( but not loot in chests , those stay opened and empty ) doors stay open , and any keys you have collected remain effective if there are any ng+ enemy types in the area , they will spawn ng+ bp enemies and ng+ bp npcs will spawn in the area ( the bp npcs will not respawn if killed unless another ascetic is burned ) enemies have more hp , deal more damage , and drop more souls on death if there is a boss within the bonfire 's area , it will respawn if the boss drops any additional loot in ng+ or higher , it will drop that loot when killed in addition to the loot it normally drops ( boss souls , etc ) bosses have more hp , deal more damage , and drop more souls on death note that the effects of the bonfire ascetic are permanent and will continue into future difficulties as well . this means that if you use one in ng ( thus making an area into ng+ difficulty ) , the area will be in ng++ difficulty when you move to ng+ .
only if he has a passive so good that being able to move him from mash/boil to cleaning or fermenting would allow you to bring in another employee with another highly desirable passive and not enough patience to be useful . in other words , it gives you the flexibility to rearrange your brewing process . if you place no value on that flexibility , there is no advantage to leveling up .
yes ( as noted by the half life wikia ) you can get them out of order if you miss some and need to go back for them . unfortunately i do not think the achievement visibly allows you to track your progress , but it does take note if you have ever found one at all .
text in italics is directly from the collectors edition guide book . as with any lore-driven question this is completely speculative and is my personal opinion based on the guide book , item descriptions , and leaps of faith i make , take all of this with a grain of salt . deep within the earth beneath majula lies an anarchic settlement of filth and chaos built by the forsaken souls cast into the pit . at the bottom of the pit is the gutter , a half put-together shantytown ( resembling blighttown from dsi ) that is very dark , and very full of poison . we know that aldia used this to throw his unwanted experiments in , and many kingdoms in the past have used the pit as a garbage dump . many of the enemies in the gutter and black gulch are remnants of aldia 's experiments , the hunting dog is born from the experiments conducted by lord aldia , and the corrosive ant queen 's presence in the gutter seems to suggest that it began its life in the laboratory of lord aldia 's mansion and eventually outlived its usefulness . so the creatures in the black gulch are failed experiments . really the only thing we can know for sure is that the rotten is an amalgamation of these lost souls in the gutter that have made their way to black gulch . we know that the rotten absorbed so many life forces that he came to possess a wondrous soul of his own , which explains how he has a great soul . anything more than this is dedicated lore . there is speculation that the rotten is pharros the vagabond but even this theory takes some lore leaps . also unexplained is the ng+ ' old dead one soul ' that may be a nod to nito , with it is obvious visual parallels to the rotten ( this soul creates the crypt greatsword , which could be further evidence to a nito connection ) . further lore connections can be made by the central location of hexes found around him , a possibility that navlaan was cast down the pit when he was outcast from majula . finally , the surviving giants guarding the forgotten key , remnants of the war in which you traverse in the giant memories . as for everything in the souls series , there is no clear cut answer , only vague correlations to descriptions and dialogue in game .
if you need a particular weapon , like a shotgun , assault rifle , battle rifle etc , you can swap your current weapon with a marine to take his . so marines can be a good way to get weapons in certain situations . additionally , a marine will carry any weapon you give him until he is killed , or you swap with him again . this also means that marines can be used to transport weapons . say you know that you are going to want a sniper rifle you have found later on in a level , but you do not want to carry it with you in between . if you give it to a marine , you can carry two other weapons , and then simply swap with the marine again once decide you need the sniper rifle , provided that the marine has survived to that point in the mission . an element of this that can be used to even greater advantage , is that marines do not use any ammunition . what this means , is that even if the weapon you give to one only has one round of ammunition left in it , the marine will be able to use it without limit . this also means that while transporting a weapon for you , the marine is free to use it without expending any of your ammunition . important to note here is that you can not give a marine an empty weapon . in short , if you have got a decent weapon that is almost out of ammunition , give it to a marine ; while the marines may not be able to operate weaponry as effectively as most players , you will still likely benefit more from having the desired weapon as an asset to your mission in the hands of a marine than you would if you had depleted it yourself and thrown it away . they can also be used to refill ammunition on a weapon that both you and a marine are carrying . as long as you have at least 2 extra ( and unique ) weapons nearby , you can swap your low-ammo weapon for one of them , then swap it to the marine for his weapon . at this point , you should be holding the marine 's weapon , and you need to switch it for the second unwanted weapon , making sure that you drop it at least a few meters away from your original weapon ( if you do not want to collect its ammo and completely deplete it ) . then pick up your original , low-ammo weapon again ( dropping the second unwanted weapon ) and give it to the marine , then finally switch the first unwanted weapon for the higher-ammo one you left on the ground . this process is actually much simpler than it sounds , and you should be able to figure it out easily on your own while playing . because of the fact that marines do not use ammunition , i always try to give my marines certain weapons once i have almost depleted them ( particularly explosives ) . in order starting with most desirable : fuel rod gun/cannon rocket launcher brute shot needler sniper rifle beam rifle depending on the circumstance , you may want to give your marines different weaponry , but to be brutally honest , i almost never really notice their " support " unless they are equipped with one of the above weapons . in regards to the warthog , i also often try to make sure that the marine in the passenger seat is equipped with a rocket launcher or fuel rod gun/cannon . this seems to be easily the most effective strategy in most situations . however , in rare circumstances you may want to equip your passenger with a weapon that can be fired more accurately , or rapidly ( or safely ) .
so here is how i solved it : i deleted both 3 and 4 i placed the player to 5 and entered the portal in-game this spawned a new portal ( 6 ) in the nether because there was no portal in range to link to . i used mcedit because i think this is a defect in the game , but if you are not lazy like me or want to play without cheating , you can travel in the nether from 2 and destroy 4 , go back via 2 , then travel to 3 in the overworld and destroy it there , then travel to 5 and enter ( the numbers here correspond to the picture i added in the post ) .
does the ferram status window start saying " minor stalling detected " at any point ? i suspect that your wings are losing lift due to stalling , and if your wings are stalling , then your control surfaces are also likely stalling , which means they can not bite the wind to bring the plane back under control . without video to see exactly what you are doing wrong , or how the plane is behaving , that is about all i can tell you . with ferram , you have to start out simple , and increment your designs . it is unforgiving in its realism , just like real aeronautical engineering . if you are having a lot of trouble with this type of thing , take a look at scott manley 's videos on aircraft design ( part 1 , part 2 , part 3 ) . he shows how to improve inherent stability , among other things .

if you appointed anderson to the council , he steps down later to prepare for the reaper invasion . you can read up on this in the codex : after the alliance victory in the battle of the citadel , anderson briefly served as the citadel 's first human councilor . he soon became embroiled in a cerberus plot to abduct his friend kahlee sanders , however , and learned that he was unable to live a life without action . he stepped down as councilor and returned to the military to prepare for the reaper invasion . the alliance parliament named donnel udina as his successor . the events mentioned in the codex take place in the book mass effect:retribution .
yes . diablo 3 does not allow offline play . if you want to play with someone else , they must each make it past the log-in screen . . . which means you will both require a separate copy and associated diablo 3 licence . also of note is that you may only have one diablo 3 per battle .netaccount , so your wife will need to set up an additional battle .netaccount to be able to play with you . if you purchase a physical copy , however , you will be able to share the installation disk , but diablo 3 does not require a cd to run .
yes , you can . this website explains : you will have to get the blueprint for the child 's bed from rebecca for 3200 g . the blueprint requires 10 black lumber , 5 suffolk wool , 10 alpaca wool and 1 pink diamond . after marriage , the pregnancy event will trigger in 30 days . if you do not have the child 's bed , then the event will be postponed until you have one . the pregnancy lasts 60 days , and there is no gameplay difference . the baby will stay in its bed not moving for 62 days , then he/she will start the crawling cutscene . after the cutscene , the baby will return to it is bed . you can now talk to the baby , but you can not give it gifts . after 62 more days , the baby will develop into a child , he/she will move about the farm and you can now give him/her gifts . after at least 30 days and 60,000 fp , the harvest goddess will come to you house and give your child a piece of candy . this will turn them into a teenager for 30 days , not a full 31-day season . after 30 days , the candy will wear off and they will revert back into a child . your teenager can only forage , same as your spouse , on fridays and saturdays if the weather is sunny . if you want another piece of candy , give alice the harvest sprite some royal jelly . the mountain honey bee is the only bee that can produce the royal jelly needed .
well you can use the instructions on the page : the difficulty settings are governed by the script in : \DATA\SCRIPTS00.BIF\witcher_atr_abl.luc decompile this script using any utility that is listed in the luc format article under the file formats category . open up the resulting file in any text editor . in the text editor you should be able to copy the settings for hard into the settings for easy or normal ( maybe back up the file in case you want to revert ) . then just recompile it and stick it back in . edit : the save file format is laid out here . i am not sure whether difficulty is stored as a " resource " or not . if the resource names are plain text , it should not be hard to figure out whether that is the case .
this is straight from rockstar 's website . the short answer is no , you need to have separate accounts and there is no way to migrate an offline account to an online one . source of information is here : http://support.rockstargames.com/entries/20634122-information-about-social-club-accounts-in-l-a-noire hope this helps .
no . the mod 's official page does not mention the ability to track mobs . mobs are entities , which are very different from blocks , and can thus not be tracked with scenter .
yes , this feature was introduced in the free content patch that coincided with the release of the paid dlc " legacy of rome " , if your game is up to date you should have this feature .
diablo 3 is cross-region . it is the same as diablo 2 and starcraft 1 . you select the region in-game and can create characters on that region , and change at any time ( characters are not available cross-realm ) . it is not like sc2 where you need 4 versions . so , whether you buy the us or eu version , it differs not .

according to http://terraria.gamepedia.com/spike_ball : they spawn and despawn off-screen like any other enemy — if you leave a room and return later , it will have a different configuration of spike balls . so unfortunately , any steps you take to control an individual spike ball will be rendered moot when you leave and come back because the spike ball will almost certainly have moved . edit : here 's a way to potentially use this for your benefit : if there is a spike ball in an especially difficult position ( say , so that it makes it impossible to get to a chest ) , you can leave the area and come back later . unfortunately , since navigating the dungeon is nasty enough , this will only help with the worst spike balls .
the temple run series is like jetpack joyride , it is based on momentum . you collect speed over running and the most efficient way to lose it is to ' resurrect ' by using gems or wings depending on which game you play . tripping , or collecting powerups , has nothing to do with your speed .
i am going to suggest two methods that are by far the fastest . buy deeds of valor . this is the quickest method if you are already farming the timeless isle for lesser charms of good fortune in order to get you are weekly allowance of 3 warforged seals since you are probably also earning timeless coins at the same time . if you are sitting on more than 3000 coins , it will take you only as long as you running to mistweaver ai and purchasing them from her . run heroic scenarios . find 2 friends and/or randoms in /trade and queue up . they are extremely fast to complete . i play a resto druid primarily , so i look for 2 dps when running them . having at least 1 tank or healer is helpful , but the final group composition is not terribly important ( just do not stand in fire ) , and there is no queue time once you have assembled your 3-person group . some of the scenarios include npc 's that can also heal you and none of the mobs you kill drop loot , so the 3 person group can move from pack to pack pretty quickly . but speaking from experience , a healer will allow you to jump right into the larger groups of mobs and just aoe everything down . be mindful of the bonus objectives , as they are timed events that can be completed for an extra 30 valor . some thoughts : i would probably avoid random heroic dungeons . they are not worth as much as heroic scenarios , and you will probably be spending a fair amount of time in a queue waiting for the group to be formed . i tend to only do 1 random heroic dungeon since the first one is worth 80 valor , but only if i can not find people interested in running a heroic scenario . however , as i mention above , i am a resto druid so i do not have to sit in long queue times like dps characters need to . since it sounds like you are freshly level 90 , keep raiding because you could probably use the upgrades . be mindful to how much valor raiding is worth , and then supplement that with heroic scenarios or deeds of valor as appropriate . if you are starting to max out the lfr upgrades , start looking for flex raids . you will get higher ilevel versions of the gear that is in lfr , while still earning the valor from boss kills . when you have cleared out all 4 soo raids , finish off your weekly valor earnings with heroic scenarios .
you can get the magic powder from the witch 's house north of kakariko ( before you enter the eastern palace ) : head back to the main part of kakariko village and go all the way up and out of the village . head right to the next screen . continue going right to the next screen . keep going right another screen . pass through the graveyard to the next screen . go down a screen and cross the bridge . after the bridge go up a screen after killing the enemies and cutting through the bushes . make a right here . go up and give the mushroom to the witch just outside of the shop . afterwords , head left a screen and return back to the witch . go inside the shop and the magic powder will be waiting for you . talk to the guy in there to fill up your hearts . exit the shop .

if you owned the game as a cd then you need a cd to play it . you can not just download it for free . you can check if you purchased the game online at http://www.xbox.com : click on " my account " click on " billing history " enter your login credentials ( you will end up at commerce.microsoft.com ) click on " transaction " adjust search criteria and click the " search " button . there you should see something like " street fighter 4 ae : xbox 360 edition " as the description with a " purchase " transaction type . if it is there you should simply be able to download the game again either via xbox . com or directly from your xbox . i think this is the link to the game you are talking about : http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-us/product/super-streetfighter-iv-arcade-edition/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802434307fc however , if it is not an online purchase then you need the cd to play it again .
rock giants apparently have an ability that puts up a swirly shield that will reflect projectiles away from it , and cause said projectiles to damage you and your party . this is especially dangerous if you have large projectiles and/or lots of friends playing with you . anytime you see this swirly garbage , switch to a non-projectile attack ( e . g . disintegrate , blizzard , electrocution , etc . ) .
the deduction of money is automatic , you do not have to do anything in game . once the order is sent , it will take a few minutes to get a notification in game , it really depends on the status of the rockstar servers . if you are game is on , and you are playing while submitting an order , you will have to visit a los santos shop to receive the order . if you are offline when submitting the order , starting up the game and going online should get the most recent order automatically . no extra work needed . there is not a way of seeing a record of orders in the ifruit app , the best record are the texts you receive on the character in game , though they do not contain much detail .
those words are your character 's title . the title is taken from the classmod you have equipped . there are over 100 different titles possible , so instead of writing out the whole list here , i will link to the lists of class mods on the borderlands 2 wiki . commando siren gunzerker assassin mechromancer under possible skill boost on those pages , the word in parentheses goes before the name of the classmod , so the title of a commando with the first mod and variant on the list would be front line engineer . this title replaces your normal class name .
every 30-40 minutes there is a new alert . it seems quite random at first , but that is because you only see alerts of missions you already have access to . you can check the twitter account for all alerts : https://twitter.com/warframealerts in warframe developer livestream #5 they talk a bit about how alerts are generated , at 59 min . alerts are randomly generated , except for the once started after the life stream .
flying them there manually is an option for some ships , especially if it it only one smaller ship . in lowsec it is usually enough to fill the low slots with warp core stabilizers and most gate camps will not be able to catch you . i would not try this with a battleship , but it works very well with cruisers . if you have access to a carrier , they can transport 1 million cubic meters of fitted ships . this of course only works outside of highsec . theoretically someone in a titan could bridge you to your destination if it is inside range , but that is likely not a practical solution and would also only work for one ship at once . as far as i know freighters can also transport fitted ships if you put them inside a courier contract package . fitted ships are rather large , and you will only be able to transport something like 3 battlecruisers or 9-10 cruisers that way . if you do not mind paying then you could just contract your ships to red frog and let them transport them to your destination . this only works in high-sec , in low-sec and null-sec you would use jump freighters with lower capacity and much higher costs .
no , ruins and villages are generated with the world , not actively built . if that changes in a future update , then it might not be required then , but for now all new geographic features require you to generate new chunks . the usual way of doing this is just making a new world with all new chunks , but if you walk to places that you have not yet , then new chunks will generate . ( potentially with new features . ) it is still recommended that you generate a new world though since you might have to walk a while to get to new parts , the boundary between versions might not line up right , and biomes might shift ( especially with the addition of a new one ) , but if you have not explored much or really like it so far , it might be worth it .
the japanese trainers indicate ivs using the letter " v " and indicate each stat in the order they appear on the summary of each pokemon : h = hp a = attack b = defence c = sp . atk d = sp . def s = speed if you have a 3 perfect iv pokemon with perfect hp , def , and sp . def , you would input something like : 3v hbd if you are looking for pokemon with hidden abilities be on the look out for these characters : ゆめ or ユメ ( yume , lit . dream ) . you can find the different natures in japanese here . typically , if the notes end in ほしい　（hoshii , lit . wanted）or ください （kudasai , lit . please ) , this indicates that text the came before it is something that trainer wants . if you see です（desu , lit . it is） at the end , it usually means to affirm preceding text . e.g. , "3vadsです , 3vhbcほしい" could indicate that the japanese trainer is offering : a 3 perfect attack , sp . def , and speed iv ( a , d , s ) pokemon and wants : a 3 perfect hp , def , and sp . atk iv ( h , b , c ) pokemon
so this is a bit of an interesting issue . to answer this , we need to take a closer look at the damage formula : base damage = &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; ( weapon damage range + bonus damage from gear ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &times ; bonus from primary attribute &dagger ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &times ; other class bonuses from skills . ability damage = &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; base damage ( as above ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &times ; % weapon damage listed on the ability . &dagger ; 1 primary attribute = +1% bonus damage for the purpose of this question , we can ignore ability damage and bonuses from skills . understanding the formula base damage has two main components . weapon damage ( this is the range you get , i.e. 4-6 for many starting weapons ) and primary attribute bonus ( this is 1% for every primary stat you ahve . in your case , intelligence ) . because they are being multiplied , a small weapon range gets less benefit than a large one . 4-6 damage times 200% damage ( from 100 intelligence ) is only 8-12 , whereas a weapon with 6-10 goes up to 12-20 . the higher your weapon 's average damage , the more valuable the bonus from stats is . applying our findings in your case , you have got a ton of intelligence , which is great , and a really low damage weapon , which is less great . this means that really low damage is getting multiplied by a large value , which is still , unfortunately , in your case , a really low final value . the take away here is that primary stat is not worth more than weapon damage . you need both to maximize your damage , which means you had probably be best served by dropping your 20 dps weapon and picking up something nicer . as a comparison - my wizard has a 33 dps weapon , and she is only in act iii of normal .
unless you are on a modded server , it is exceptionally rare to find a fully working vehicle . however , vehicles can be repaired to working order . to determine what repairs are needed , you can either sit in the driver seat or , while standing next to the vehicle , use the mouse wheel to select the repair menu . in either case , you will see the status of each vehicle part indicated by color . a green part is fully repaired , an orange part is damaged and a red part is broken . once a part is red , it is no longer functional . a vehicle requires the following non-broken parts to be drivable : engine ( repaired with engine parts ) fuel tank ( repaired with fuel tank parts ) all wheels ( repaired with wheels ) hull ( repaired with scrap metal ) the repair parts can be found throughout the map , but are generally located in industrial buildings . to repair a part you must have the part in your inventory and you must also have a toolkit . ( if you have picked up a toolkit , it will be placed in one of the tools slots of your inventory , next to flashlights , matches , etc ) . you can select the part to repair from the repair menu , but you must be outside the car to do so . a vehicle also requires gas . you can see the level of fuel when you are in the driver seat . if it is empty , you will not be able to start it . you will need to find a jerry can . any jerry can found in the world will already be filled with gas . however , if you have an empty can on you , you will need to find a gas station to fill it . then , you need to be standing next to the car and use the mouse wheel to select the refuel option . one final word about repairing a vehicle . it can be time consuming because of the potential many trips required back and forth from the car to towns . you can hold only so many parts at a time . so , if the vehicle you found is completely broken , you are probably looking at more than several trips to bring parts to it . here 's how many inventory slots each part takes up : engine parts = 6 slots fuel tank parts = 4 slots one wheel = 6 slots scrap metal = 3 slots jerry can = 3 slots windscreen = 1 slots ( this is not required for the vehicle to work )
the nether is just a special biome , and is generated the same way as any other biome ( except only in the nether of course ) . according to the wiki , occasionally nether biomes will spawn in the overworld ! it was a separate map theme in indev mode ( albeit with dirt/sand instead of netherack/soul sand ) , and as such had a different algorithm for generating the terrain . so yes , the nether is randomly generated , it will be different for different seeds ( it uses the same seed to generate terrain as the overworld ) .
no . legendary skins will never go on sale , and have not done so in the past . while i can not find the original official statement at the moment , the forums reassert this every few days when someone asks . it is part of their essence in addition to their exorbitant prices . they are meant for people who are willing to fork over that much just to see their little adorable void creature spew pretty fireworks .
adding more nations as playable or view-only will increase the player count and also the number of regens generated . adding additional leagues within these nations will usually increase the player count , so your intuition is correct . this post may be helpful if looking for more information on the subject .
the ai in dawn of war is pretty shocking at the best of times and frequently gets stuck at the first tech level spamming small weak units in an attempt to complete a " tech 1 rush " . typically you will find if you can hold off the initial wave the rest of the game will be a piece of cake seeing as you will have vehicles and they will still only have infantry . my main point of advice would be to use lots of little squads instead of upgrading one squad ( i.e. . i would rather have 3 different marine squads of 4 men as apposed to 1 big squad of 10 ) . this means you can engage multiple targets at once and if someone gets drawn into melee when you didnt really want them to you have another couple of squads to help clear the trouble ) . as for how to hold off this initial wave it depends on which army you are playing as and which you are fighting . for any army i would definately say make sure you build a command unit as your first or second attacking unit seeing as the extra hp will definately give you a bit more thinking time ( this is especially true of necrons seeing as the necron lord is the best unit you have at your disposal ) . . . from here its a matter of who you are fighting and knowing how they will rush you . marines / choas - will usually play a solid game with decent ai - harras you a little at the start with marine squads but continue to push through tech levels so you will need to keep up with them technologywise . with choas be careful of cultist squads because they have a tendancy to engage multiple squads in close combat at once and leave them prone to fire from another unit . elder - they will typically throw guardian squad after guardian squad at you and then throw the occassional farseer whenever they have enough spare rec ( strategy = get heavy bolters out asap - or whatever your armies equivielent is ) . orks - similiar to elder , will begin by throwing squad after squad at you but with the added danger of a big mek . this guy can be a pain in the ass because of his teleport ability which will get him to you sooner . ( strategy = you will definately need a commant unit to deal with an ork rush ) . if orks manage to get to get to tech 2 they are likely to start throwing wartraks at you , counter these with vehicles because their rockets will constantly knock your regular troops over . imperial guard - again similiar to elder , will throw lots of little units at you as well as the command squad which can be a pain because its quickly regenerates powerful units . heavy bolters ( or similiar ) are the way forward again . necrons - on big maps these guys will hardly have the chance to rush you because they are so slow , but you will need to be careful of the necron lord seeing as his teleport power recharges very quick and he can get to your base super fast because of it . engage this guy with a command unit and have everything else you have shot at him . probably best to keep his body surrounded as well because when they rebuild him it will revive in the same place it was last killed . tau - watch out for the krut rush , these can be nasty especially if they have feral leap . lots of seperate units will help with this one so that all squads are not simultaneously having to engage one squad . i didnt ever really play that much soulstorm so cant realy say more about sisters / dark elder .
i had trouble here too . move back , toward the peddler , and shoot it with swaine 's lockgun .
in your nethack options file ( its location depends on the system ) , you should set the number_pad option to 0 to use the keys hjklyubn for movement . the line to set this option is OPTIONS=number_pad:0 
underpants can be found in kyle 's room , cartman 's mom 's room , kevin 's room ( the star trek kid ) , stan 's room , and stan 's parents room ( the one that most people miss ) . stan 's house has a nonstandard floor plan . across the hall from his sister , there is a ' hidden ' door at the bottom of the screen . you will find underpants in there .
no , there is no penalty for using the try again feature . the likely reason that this was incorporated is because dual destinies expands on the bad ending feature present in previous games by having several specific , detailed game over sequences that can be found . the feature is simply to facilitate the ability to easily see all of the endings in a single run .
usually broadband just means " not dialup " . if you have even the lowest end dsl , it'll probably be playable , and anything faster than a megabit should be more than sufficient . i played the open beta on a 1mb/s connection without any problems . and wireless just tends to be buggy , especially with stuff like this where a few lost packets can make you jump around the screen and lag a lot . putting in a caveat about wireless is just a way for them to wash their hands of your local network problems .
no , once you get rid of a move you can not use it battle sense or out of battle . it is gone and it can not be used . to get rid of a hm move you can go to a " move delete tutor " in dendemille town , in a house , up and right from the pokemon center ( next to some stairs ) , is the move deleter and the move reminder . the move deleter is to the left side of the house after entering , and the reminder is in the right side of the house . dendemille town is after the 6th badge i believe . so until then anything you teach to your pokemon you keep , so just be careful
i can not really speak for the elite skill 's power . i assume though that it is on par with the other summon skills . it does not give an advantage to people with it , just another choice of elite skill . it is not necessarily a better one . the miniature rytlock is a cosmetic item : it will make a miniature character run after you . the miniature does not fight , and can not help you in any way . the golem banker is a convenience item , allowing you a fast access to your bank , from almost any place in the game world . it is a consumable , usable only once . once used , it lasts 5 days . the chalice of glory is a one-time-use item giving 5000 of glory to your account . this allows you to buy cosmetic upgrades for your pvp weapons . the tome of influence is also a one-time-use item which gives 1000 of influence to the guild you currently represent . influence allows the guild to do research , and unlock guild services . note that an equivalent to the tome of influence is earned through the game , the letter of commendation . all in all , it does not really give a gameplay advantage over people with the normal edition . you just get items which are mostly convenient , or cosmetic .
i know you can get gift codes for minecraft . i have not heard of cards , but if they do exist , i am sure they have nothing more than a similar gift code on them . this may be to enable people without credit cards to easily buy a premium minecraft account . just for the sake of comprehensiveness , a gift code allows you to upgrade a free minecraft account to a premium one . however , as @lunboks stated , this is the first i have ever heard of this . you may have gotten gift card confused with gift code .
as long as you do not attack a enemy champion in tower range it will make a tower lose focus .
first and foremost , farming a stone of jordan is not the most reliable , as it can take you some time . your character level does not affect what loot is dropped , only the monster 's level . however , your magic find can greatly affect what loot is dropped . if you are looking for this specific drop , nightmare andariel ( final boss of act 1 , in nightmare difficulty ) has the highest drop rate . she has a better chance of dropping rings than some other bosses , and she is the appropriate level to drop a stone of jordan instead of a different unique ring ( she has fewer rings that she can drop due to her level ) . this said , you will not get nearly as much other loot just farming nightmare andariel . if you are looking to have a more beneficial farming experience whilst looking for a stone of jordan , i suggest farming a different boss , like hell andariel , nightmare mephisto , or hell mephisto . though you will see a lower drop chance for this ring , you will see plenty of other useful loot while you are looking for it . be aware that looking for this specific drop , even off of nightmare andariel ( the boss with the highest drop chance ) , you may be killing her over a thousand times before you see this ring drop , if you see this ring drop . source : lots of personal diablo ii playtime .
some of them will come at you regularly and some of them will not reveal themselves until you have reached a certain spot , so keep moving , but take it slowly . going kamikaze on veteran means certain death . as soon as you clear all positions , they stop spawning . you can roll barrels burning ( just knife them by pressing " use " key ) and use the machine gun at the side to make things easier .
just for the sake of completeness , i am going to take chris ' profession guide link and reduce it to ore amounts . that'll at least give you the " minimum " amount . absolute minimum the technical absolute minimum is 0 ore , as you had just buy all the bars/gems you need from the auction house and you had never deal with ore at all . minimim w/ mining this answer will include the minimum figured assuming you only mine for bars and dust and that all gems come from the auction house . 160 copper ore 60 tin ore 140 mithril ore 15 truesilver ore 50 thorium bar 200 adamantite ore 10 titanium ore minimum w/ mining and prospecting this answer assumes that you had obtain each gem from the common ore most likely to drop it via prospecting based on figures on wowhead . however , i also assumed no gems dropped during mining , which means these values will not be the absolute minimum . 160 copper ore 310 tin ore add 150 more for horde characters add 200 more if you had rather not farm/buy small illustrious pearls 125 iron ore 215 mithril ore 15 truesilver ore 250 thorium ore add 50 more if you had rather not farm/buy powerful mojos 200 fel iron ore or adamantite ore add 75 more if you had rather not farm/buy black diamonds 220 adamantite ore 350 cobalt ore 25 saronite ore 10 titanium ore 3205 obsidium ore ( 500 + 2700 from shadowspirit diamond and fire prism transmutes ) quick average : mining and prospecting for the purposes of this answer , i assume that everything you do will skill you a point in jewelcrafting , but i incorporate the average percentage drop of gems from the ore that is most likely to drop that gem . for obsidium ore , the figure is the same as the minimum . assuming each gem has an equal chance to drop , you will be obtaining the gems in equal numbers . since you need 3 of each of them for the transmutes , the percentage that you will get a gem you need is 100% until you have gotten enough of that gem for all the transmutes you had need . 160 copper ore 755 tin ore add 400 more for horde characters add 535 more if you had rather not farm/buy small illustrious pearls 420 iron ore 390 mithril ore 15 truesilver ore 1155 thorium ore add 170 more if you had rather not farm/buy powerful mojos 1180 fel iron ore or adamantite ore add 445 more if you had rather not farm/buy black diamonds 310 adamantite ore 1400 cobalt ore 140 saronite ore 10 titanium ore 3205 obsidium ore ( 500 + 2700 from shadowspirit diamond and fire prism transmutes ) quick 90th percentile with the absence of data points from actual instances or simulations , i cheated on this one . my calculation for the 90th percentile was ( ( [ avg ] - [ min ] ) + [ avg ] * . 9 ) + [ bar ] , where avg - average ore needed to prospect gems based on drop rate min - minimum ore needed to prospect gems bar - ore needed for bars it is not perfect , and it also assumes that you always skill when crafting things with jewelcrafting . the same caveat applies to obsidium in this answer as it does in the quick average . 160 copper ore 1120 tin ore add 610 more for horde characters add 815 more if you had rather not farm/buy small illustrious pearls 670 iron ore 540 mithril ore 15 truesilver ore 1950 thorium ore add 550 more if you had rather not farm/buy powerful mojos 2245 fel iron ore or adamantite ore add 765 more if you had rather not farm/buy black diamonds 385 adamantite ore 2310 cobalt ore 240 saronite ore 10 titanium ore 3205 obsidium ore ( 500 + 2700 from shadowspirit diamond and fire prism transmutes ) true average and 90th percentile it quickly gets too complicated for me to want to bother attempting this in a completely legitimate fashion . one would have to make sure they had enough base inventory to accomplish both feats which results in a trickle-back effect where you have to go back and make older stuff again at times . that is best left for either a simulation program or someone with free time and a burning desire to snag your bounty . : ) for anyone interested in doing that , good luck . also , so it does not get missed , raven dreamer posted the skill up formula he found for the percent chance you will skill up on a yellow or green recipe as a comment to the original question : [ chance of gaining skill point ] = ( grey skill - current skill ) / ( grey skill - yellow skill ) " grey skill " and " yellow skill " are the numbers at which the recipe turns grey or yellow respectively .
via bureaucracy , research " deployment": this requires a warden - to unlock the chief - the chief , and offices for both . once unlocked , you get access to the deployment tab in the menu bar , which offers a bunch of selections : there , select " staff only " , and click on the area you want to change : this means that only staff are allowed to enter this area ( in this case , the chief 's office ) on their own - guards can still escort prisoners through these areas , and staff will not avoid secured areas , just because a staff only route is available . as such , yes , it can be used to prevent escapes ( hints from the deployment wiki article : ) by designating areas such as the kitchen , and the corridors leading up to it as staff only , you can greatly reduce the amount of knifes stolen . the same principle applies to storage . if you have fenced off your entire prison , you could designate the entire area inside and outside the fence as staff only to isolate cell blocks from eachother . do remember to provide passage to canteens and showers if these are in a seperate building . also : this is not a new feature of alpha 10 . alpha 9 introduced the new jobs feature , but this has existed for a while before already .
right where you enter the arena for that battle , there is a cliff on the left hand side going up . if you look down from it you should see the tents and ammo crates to the right . from this ledge you can easily snipe the hive 's eyes ( revolvers are faster in my opinion though . . . spam works ) . use a smg or shotgun for the swooping rakks . use your action skill for health ! ! there is a skill that lets your bloodwing steal health for you and another that increases the number of enemies that it can attack . the combination helps against the waves of rakk and the acid balls that the hive shoot at you . just throw the bloodwing out whenever there are rakk and you will be ok . good luck !
use minutor , or some other mapping program to work out the coordinates of your epic castle ( in minutor , the coordinates of the block under the cursor are shown in the status bar at the bottom ) . then in-game , press f3 to see your coordinates and walk to the coordinates you found . then sleep in a bed and reset your spawn ! !
you cannot do that in the game by default . you will need a camera mod for it .

this looks be exactly what you are looking for : ps3 steering wheel comparison guide . it also compares them across rough price ranges so you can also use it to find the best for your budget rather than just an overly expensive one that is the best overall .
i did this on one of my easy runthroughs of the game , and there is nothing in particular that happens . there is no associated achievement , either . there is a post-game statistics screen that compares your performance to the statistics of others , where you can feel proud about your accomplishment , however .
you are able to walk straight through the door of the secret room once you have beaten all the campaign maps on any difficulty . inside contains a bunch of easter eggs as well as the item crate you mentioned containing weapons of your ' parents ' . you will know the door is open when the bright glowing open sign above the door is lit up .
falling speed is explained in the " transportation " page on the wiki : every tick ( 1/20 second ) , non-flying players and mobs have their vertical speed decremented ( less upward motion , more downward motion ) by 0.08 blocks per tick ( 1.6 m/s ) , then multiplied by 0.98 . this would produce a terminal velocity of 3.92 blocks per tick , or 78.4 m/s . terminal velocity as stated above , terminal velocity in minecraft is 78.4 m/s , but this speed cannot be reached in survival mode : however , the sky is not quite high enough for that : falling from layer 256 to bedrock takes about 5.5 seconds , with impact at 3.5 blocks per tick ( 70 m/s ) . in creative mode , you can fly higher , and could potentially reach terminal velocity falling from " above the sky " . acceleration acceleration is not talked about on the wiki , however see the change in velocity over time in the following graph . the graph was created using the formula : v ( t ) = ( 0.98 t - 1 ) × 3.92 you will notice that acceleration is not constant , and decreases over time . how long ? using the velocity time graph , we can find how long it would take to reach terminal velocity . 10% terminal velocity ( 0.392 blocks/tick ) : ≈ 5 ticks ( 0.4 seconds ) 50% terminal velocity ( 1.96 blocks/tick ) : ≈ 35 ticks ( 1.75 seconds ) 75% terminal velocity ( 2.94 blocks/tick ) : ≈ 69 ticks ( 3.45 seconds ) 99% terminal velocity ( 3.8808 blocks/tick ) : ≈ 228 ticks ( 11.4 seconds ) 100% terminal velocity ( 3.92 blocks/tick ) : ≈ 672 ticks ( 33.6 seconds ) chicken science ! i could not find anything on the falling speed of chickens , so i set my own apparatus to test . it involves a 10 block fall with a pressure plate at the bottom , turning on a redstone lamp . i start the timer at the same time that i press the button , and stop the timer when i see the lamp turn on : i timed the fall of 3 different chickens to ensure accurate results : test 1: 5.0 seconds test 2: 4.9 seconds test 3: 5.1 seconds this averages out at 5 seconds for a chicken to fall 10 blocks . using the formula for speed we can calculate the speed of a falling chicken : speed = distance / time speed = 10 / 5 speed = 2 m/s ∴ the falling speed of a chicken is 2 m/s . higher ? as per the op 's request , i did the test again at a greater height , 50 blocks to be exact : i timed the test the same as the others , and received another result : higher test 1: 25.0 seconds the first test i did came back with 25 seconds flat , i did not feel a need to repeat any more tests : speed = distance / time speed = 50 / 25 speed = 2 m/s note : i was using unladen european chickens . i also noticed that chickens reach their maximum velocity as soon as they started falling . no chicken were harmed in the making of this answer :
if it`s not been changed after the release of the ps4 . the playstation network cards are country specific if not i all cases then in most . it does not matter if the currency is the same it is still locked to that specific area . look at the the flag in top left corner . http://uk.playstation.com/pscards/
create a squad for them . create a point in the notes menu . station squad at that point . pull lever .
there will never be a point where you are forced to get renegade points ( see the comments for a possible exception ) , or forced to get paragon points . there are points where you have to pick one or the other , but never a point where you are offered only one option . they changed this from mass effect 2 where at the end of a mission you had get 5 points each . people complained that they wanted to play an entirely renegade or entirely paragon playthrough , but were forced to get some points in the other alignment . they changed this system to getting neutral reputation now . the only time you get paragon or renegade reputation , is when you make a specific choice .

i think your problem is this ( based on you saying it has a basement ) : if you dig into the ground at all and attempt to use the dirt wall as part of your wall , terraria thinks it is not valid housing . take out that hammer and get rid of 100% dirt walls and replace it with whatever kind of wall you want .
the playstation welcome bac k promotion has unfortunately expired . it ended on july 5th , 2011 . it was temporarily extended , as its previous end date was july 1st . however , the offer is definitely over now .
you can easily check on how many “open” missions your three characters have by pressing and holding the down button on the d-pad . when the radial character switch interface appears , you’ll usually notice a number over each character portrait . this number denotes how many missions the character hasn’t yet started ; if there’s no number , there are no new missions to be collected . http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/surviving-in-los-santos-a-guide-to-get-you-started-in-grand-theft-auto-v/
so i tested @mr smooth 's recommendation and it is indeed true . if you have been caught , then you need to trigger a load* by doing a large zone transition . a small one ( such as going from the ragged flagoon to the ratway ) was not enough to cause the flag to be reset . however , transitioning from the cistern to solitude was enough to cause the reset and i was able to immediately attempt to steal again . in short , if you are in a town with a gate , then exit the town and go back in . simply going into a house in the town is probably not enough to reset the flag . if you are not in a gated town , just fast travel to somewhere far enough that requires a load .
among other things , you may be sensitive to : frame rate strobing or shifting colors sensation of movement disparity between visual and other sensory input depending on your platform and environment you probably do not have much control over these . you can try the following , but as david said you should probably consult with your doctor also . do not play in a dark room - leave a lamp or other soft light on position your chair and screen so that you are sitting comfortably and looking directly ahead at the screen play with whatever visual settings are available to maximize frame rate and minimize visual strobing back up a bit so that the screen does not dominate your vision . this has two effects - it minimizes the sensory conflict , and also minimizes your awareness of screen refresh/frame rate
to dock you will need to request permission by selecting the station in the contacts pane in navigation and then select " request docking": this will give you a designated dock to land in and a time limit for docking permission .
diablo iii 's regions affect a number of things in game : your selected region affects which server farm you connect to . the americas region 's servers are located in the usa , europe 's are ( obviously ) in europe , and asia 's servers are in korea . australian and nz players will be assigned to the the americas region by default , and hence the usa server farm . there are no south-east asian ( singapore ) servers for diablo iii . the real money auction house ( rmah ) is region locked - the only rmahs you have access to are those for the region your country of residence resides in . however , you may still have access to multiple rmahs , as rmahs are also divided by currency . this page lists the rmahs you can have access to depending upon your country of residence . to use australia as the example , the usd rmah will have more items because of the us 's larger player population , but the aud rmah will not have any currency conversion fees ( source ) . these currency-based rmahs are separate , i.e. an item on the usd rmah will not appear on any other currency 's rmah , even those in the same region . the gold auction house is not locked within a region , but is region-specific , i.e. the european gold auction house cannot be accessed to provide items for characters in the americas region . players and items cannot be transferred across regions . any item you buy on a rmah or gold auction house cannot be transferred to a character in a different region . note that which version of the game you buy does not affect which region you are assigned to at all , i.e. buying a uk version of the game and playing in the usa or australia will not mandate or even default to the europe region . the default region selection is based off your country of residence in your battle .netaccount 's settings .
if you are within about 1-4 blows of killing an opponent , a " finishing move " animation may appear , depicting one or several fatal strikes from either a first-person view or third-person " killcam " . if the savage strike ( one-handed ) or devastating blow ( two-handed ) perks are unlocked , there is a chance that this will be a decapitation . note that under the right circumstances , npcs and dragons will also be able to perform finishing moves , both against each other and against you . source : uesp wiki , " skyrim : combat " article finishing / kill moves are not completely random . finishing moves are affected by the in-game variables , ' killmoverandom ' ( default : 50% ) , and ' decapitationchance ' ( default : 40% ) and various factors , some of which are : kill cameras will only be performed if killing the enemy will take the player out of the combat mode . due to this , killing the last active/aggressive enemy will often trigger a finishing move / kill cam . but this does not mean that only killing the last active/aggressive enemy will trigger a kill cam , e.g. killing an enemy while sneaking and remaining undetected will allow a kill camera , even if there are more enemies present . the opponent being killed . some enemies in the game seem to have no finishing moves associated with them . your position relative to the enemy . for example , there is a one-handed sword stab-through-the-middle execution that will only play if you are standing behind a humanoid opponent . there are also finishing moves which require your enemy to have surrendered and fallen down to their hands and knees . it should be noted that your steath state has an affect as well . eg , you can cut throats with a dagger . the terrain : finishing moves appear to depend on relative elevation . while it is possible to enter into a finishing move animation on uneven terrain , it is far more likely to happen if both you and the enemy are standing on a flat , level surface . other nearby obstacles : if the enemy npc is too close to an object like a table , it may interrupt the animation and leaving you standing there until enough time has passed and the game gives you back control of your character . chance : some animations seem to play more often than others . slow time : finishing moves will not trigger while under the effects of the dragon shout slow time . source : uesp wiki , " skyrim : combat " talk page ( edited to take into account the comments in reply to the original post ) | tes wiki , " kill camera " article ( edited to explain further ) you can modify the finishing move-related variables using the console commands , set killmoverandom to &lt;0-100&gt; and set decapitationchance to &lt;0-100&gt; . or , use mods like skytweak ( configuration page screenshot ) , the dance of death - a killmove mod ( configuration page screenshot ) or killmove control which have uis to help configure those settings . ' the dance of death ' mod can even remove the ' last active enemy ' restriction .
the backup utility will backup everything , the only limitation is that copy-protected items will not restore on a different ps3 machine than the machine they were backed up from . ( reference ) so to use the backup utility on a 4gb usb key you would probably need to first delete everything except your game saves , i.e. all your music , videos , photos and game installs/patches .
it seems that a good portion of the weapons have had some change to them . you can check out the changes in the patch notes here : http://blogs.battlefield.com/2012/04/xbox-360-patch-going-live-april-3rd/ so to answer the question : it probably depends on which weapon/s you mostly use and get used against you . for example , the m16a4 has had its vertical recoil increased , but horizontal recoil decreased , while the m416 has not changed at all .
yes , after the latest patch many people have reported weird dragon behavior . for example dragons flying backwards . this should be resolved in a later patch .
general stuff the biggest disadvantage with mortars is that you show up on the enemy map as soon as you fire a shot . put it up , even before you fire your first shot . assuming the enemy team does not have mortars , you can fire a few shots before they hunt you down . but as soon as one of them also switches to mortar it is dangerous to fire more than 2 shots , sometimes even one is the maximum before they counter-mortar you . also , if you shot , move , shot , move , and so on , they will be more alert and just wait for you to put up your mortar somewhere . if you do something else in the meantime and set up a mortar after a break of a minute or so , you may be able to fire a few more shots before they are on to you again . smoke you switch between normal shells and smoke using 1 and 2 on pc and left and right on dpad . smoke does not need to be unlocked . vehicles you should only use the mortar against vehicles if they are not moving , or only moving in a confined space . for example , on rush maps when they are defending/attacking an mcom and only move back and forth a few meters , mortars can be useful . take on for the team if you are a team player and do not care about dying often , spamming the mcom with a mortar can decide over win or lose , so this is really one of the good uses for the mortar . you do not lose points when dying , but the smoke you deploy on the mcom or the enemies you kill that are defusing or arming it can make a difference .
yes followers weapons lose charge when they use them . ( source ) however some say they they lose charge at a slower rate than normal . ( source ) however , i do not believe there is an easier way to recharge the weapon that your follower is using . looks like you will have to periodically check it and then take it from them and recharge it and then give it back .
houses need to fulfill a set of requirements to be considered a proper house . the step-by-step guide to making a house is as follows : the room must be at least approximately 42 blocks away from any corruption . build the walls and roof . the room must be five tiles tall at the least , not counting the roof itself . the floor cannot be only wood platform , there must be a place for the npc to stand without him standing on wood platforms . make sure the room is big enough to be considered a proper house as well . fill in the house with background walls . any player-placed wall will work . place a light source inside the room . a torch on the wall works fine , but you can also use candles and other such fancy items . you can make said fancy decorations with metals at an anvil . place at least one " comfort item" ( chair ) and a " flat surface item" ( table ) in the house . place a door in the house , in one of the walls . assuming you have done everything right , the game should treat your room as a house . the first house you build will be taken by the guide , and any further houses by whichever npcs appear . there is also a size limit ( 60-750 tiles including walls , floor and ceiling ) , and the first house you build will always go to the guide .
mods will be compatible as long as they do not overwrite the same files in minecraft.jar . you can check this by looking at the class files in the mod ( that have obfusticated names like a.class or bg.class , and you need to put into minecraft.jar ) and checking that there is no overlap between the two lists of files .
the simplest forge recipe would be 4 karma-purchased items => one random karma-purchased item . since the items in question are bought with karma , they can neither be sold nor disassembled , but you should be able to do this with some of the 70-karma accessories ( or 280 karma total -- essentially one event at max level ) from the starting zones .
in previous versions , the final level was available for each world as soon as you unlocked it . then they made some big changes to the game including keeping level 25 ( the boss fight ) locked for each world . each world 's level 25 is unlocked as part of an update . imo this mechanic is an attempt to prolong interest in the game without adding more content . this mechanic was not conveyed well , especially for people who'd already completed a world only to find it now saying 24/25 complete with level 25 mysteriously unavailable . i assume far future will work the same way . its level 25 will be unlocked for everyone in some future update .
it depends . if you shot upper body , then player will die or fall unconscious . if you shot lower body , then player will be alive and , maybe , fall on the ground , if you shot in the leg . from my expirience , this weapon also depend on murphy 's law . you will kill with one shot on long distance , but in close combat you will need 2 shots and reloading time will be enough to your enemy to land you deadly shot or critical hits with axe .
if you are referring to ebonstone , according to wiki , you can destroy it using a nightmare pickaxe ( or better ) , dynamite , or purify it first using purification powder and then mine it normally .
ftb does not , as of the time of writing , support bukkit . if you want to maintain bukkit functionality and the ability to use plugins , you should follow sevensideddie 's suggestion and rebuild ftb from the ground up on mcpc . you can find information on the contents of the various ftb packs here .
just go into the level you want to play and than wait for other to join ( you have to stay near the entrance of the level though . if you go past the sackbody sign the game will close it . be patient and someone will pop-out . ( hopefully a skilled player ) or you can send invitation to your friends while waiting for them in the level . ( send them a message with the name of the level ) . have fun : )
no , there appear to be no in-game advantages provided with the call of duty elite premium account . i would consider everything besides the dlc included with the premium membership to be fluff ( just my opinion ) , but definitely nothing that gives you a competitive advantage in-game with extra perks , weapons , etc . the full list of what is included is here . the things that are listed as extras with elite premium : all dlc daily competitions exclusive clan benefits ( exclusive emblems and tags ) pro video guides and tactics ( tutorials ? ) premium groups early access to new features upload hd videos access to call of duty elite tv . all other features are accessible by free members , like stats , setting up your loadouts , etc .
depending on the version of forza 4 you have , you might be out of luck . the best solution i can think of ( without getting into a system hack ) would be to sell your game and purchase a us-region specific or region-unlocked game . this kind of sucks , i admit , but maybe you can get lucky with a trade . either that , or trade in the system . if you own an ntsc-u/c ( us and canada ) system , and you do not live or purchase games in the us or canada , make sure the game you purchase is region free or ntsc-u/c compatible . the regioning of a game is up to the publisher , so this will vary . to find out the region the game is meant for : on the front of the game case it will be specified below the title on the right : this title will come in 4 different varieties : ntsc | j : this means ntsc japan ( like the picture above ) ntsc : this means ntsc-u/c ( us and canada ) pal : this means pal systems ( europe ) nothing . this will be blank . this usually means the game is region-free . so look for plain ntsc and blank region-labeled games , and you should be fine .
yes , like all other spells and abilities which scale with weapon damage this damage is multiplied by your primary stat ( strength for barbarian ) . on a level 60 char you can see this when you show the damage numbers ( the numbers for the bleed would be really small in comparison to other numbers if they would not scale with your primary stat ) .

successful sneak attacks give the biggest skill increases . melee sneak attacks give 12x as much as ranged sneak attacks . the amount is flat per sneak attack and does not depend on the damage done . source : uesp .

only when you connect with a real-life player will the monsters get harder . the in-game npcs that you can recruit make no difference to the difficulty and you will continue to receive the same experience and loot . on another note , the loot differs from player to player , so you dont have to worry about people stealing it .
from @iszi ' s comments i have to post what happened . hope you do not run into the same . i first tackled the outpost where you land on x57 . it is right behind you when you land . so found the body of mendel . and how he died brutally . till then there were no stations marked on my map . then i took out the fusion gun ahead of where i landed . then repaired the transmission tower . then went and got c hymes at survey station 1 . recognized her death as a result of an explosion . at this point the game did not mark her body as found . which is why my question in the first place . i kept going back to the same station to make the game change her status to found . last i found the last survey station where montoya should have been . found all the clues to his vehicle . and then concluded that i found montoya . but at that point there is a marker on your map about montoya 's dead body . unless you pick it up even c . hymes 's body does not register as picked . this is the crucial point that the wikia article missed . i went through with the mission , let balak live . and then simon is like all where are my engineers ? i was able to answer about two them found . he said please maybe the last one might make it . picked montoya 's body and mission accomplished . :- ) in my first one i did it the other way . and i tend to rely on my journal entries a lot .
evs stand for effort values . when you catch a wild pokemon , it has no evs , and they go up through battle . every time it participates in fainting another pokemon ( either in the wild or a trainer battle ) , a pokemon will be given specific evs depending on the pokemon it defeated ( for example , machop will give attack evs , whereas abra will give special attack evs ; you can look up which evs a pokemon gives on any reasonable online pokedex ) . pokemon holding an exp . share will also gain evs even if they do not participate in the battle . evs are all tied to one of the basic stats ( attack , defense , special attack , special defense , speed , and hp ) . your pokemon can have a total of 255 evs in a single stat , and 510 evs overall . for each 4 evs you have in a given stat , that stat will be increased by 1 at level 100 . this is scaled down to whatever level your pokemon currently is , so for example at level 50 , you need 8 evs in a given stat to increase that stat by 1 . once you have 510 total evs , additional evs that pokemon would gain are simply lost . because of this , if you are really set on having a min/maxed pokemon , you need to keep track of its evs and do very specific training on pokemon that will raise the correct stats and not raise the wrong stats until the ev training is complete . otherwise , you are liable to " waste " evs in stats you do not care about . evs have existed since the beginning , but they were overhauled in the 3rd generation . i am not as well-versed in the specifics from before that change , although you can read about them at bulbapedia . there is a pokemon disease called " pokerus " ( which was introduced in generation 2 ) that will double the rate of ev gain . since ev training is very , very tedious , this rare disease is highly coveted , and it is recommended to always keep an actively infected pokemon in your box so that you have access to the disease whenever convenient .
the battle difficulty does not change by default . however , at some point a " hard mode " is supposed to be implemented that you can select while replaying battles . however , that does not appear to be implemented yet , although i have not completed campaign mode so it might be new-game-plus content . when you first click on the map icon for a ' play session ' , it brings up a description of that series of battles where it shows a " regular battle " check box . at the moment there are no other checkable boxes for me , but maybe there are for you . make sure that is checked next time .
since it seems that this question has not received a comprehensive answer , here 's my best attempt at a full list of all of the differences between hardcore and normal ( softcore ) modes : in hardcore , you : will lose the ability to play your character permanently upon your character 's death . you will also have the option to archive a profile of your dead character ( playtime , level , appearance , cause of death ) in your " hall of fallen heroes " for posterity . will lose all of your character 's equipped items , all items in your character 's inventory , and all items equipped on your followers when your character dies . any items in your stash , as well as your gold and blacksmith/jeweler status , are retained ( and are shared between all of your present and future hardcore characters ) . have a separate stash , gold pool , and blacksmith/jeweler than your normal mode characters . there is a dedicated hardcore-only auction house , and blizzard has stated that there will not be a real-money hardcore auction house . hardcore mode is an entirely separate ecosystem than normal mode . cannot trade items back and forth between hardcore and normal characters . cannot join a game with non-hardcore characters ( and they cannot join yours ) . can earn special achievements for killing bosses and reaching level thresholds on a hardcore character . many of these achievements have special rewards , such as banner designs . additionally : there are no innate differences in the strength of a hardcore character versus a normal character . so far , there is no evidence of any difference in the strength of monsters , quality of loot drops , or anything else that affects gameplay aside from the fact that your character cannot be resurrected upon death .
minecraft 1.5 made significant changes to how texture packs work . mainly it allowed for almost any block or item to be animated , separated item sprites and block textures into individual files , and allowed for default textures or sprites to be automatically used when a texture pack lacks them . the best way to start creating a texture pack is to extract all of the default textures and various ui images from minecraft.jar . in windows , this is found at %appdata%\.minecraft\bin , in linux it is at /.minecraft/bin and in os x it is found at ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/bin . once you have found it you can extract its contents using an app like winrar , 7zip , the unarchiver , etc . alternatively you can download someone else 's texture pack and edit what is already in there . the relevant files and directories in minecraft.jar are : /achievement contains the achievements screen gui /armor contains images for all of the various armor in the game /art contains images of the various paintings in the game /environment contains images for the sun , moon , snow , rain and clouds /font contains images for the font used in all text in the game /gui contains stuff like the menu background and various inventory screens and guis /item contains textures for boat , mine cart , and chest models and a few more things /misc contains various stuff like the map background , beacon textures , explosion particles , etc . /mob contains textures for the friendly and hostile mobs in the game /title contains the main title , mojang logo and some other stuff . in the bg folder are images that are used to create the panorama background in the main title screen pack.png: the thumbnail that shows up next to your pack in-game in the texture packs list pack.txt: optional , lets you add a short description that shows up in the texture packs list particles.png: contains images for various particles used in the game , like fireworks and hearts /textures/items contains sprites for all of the items in the game , each as individual files /textures/blocks contains textures for all of the blocks in the game , again as individual files to make your own texture pack , you just copy whichever images you want to change into your own folder ( the name of the folder becomes the name of your texture pack in the texture pack screen ) , keeping intact the file names and folder structures . then just edit them however you want , but keep them at the original resolution ( also keep the format as png ) . any texture files that are missing from your folder will simply be replaced with the default files once the game is running . making textures or sprites animated is a little more tricky , but this post explains the process nicely . to test your texture pack you will want to put your folder in the texturepacks folder , which you can get to by going to Options... &gt; Texture Packs &gt; Open texture pack folder . once that is done , your texture pack will show up in the texture packs list , and you can select it . once your folder is in the right place you can easily test your textures in-game as you change them by pressing t + f3 ( this reloads the currently selected texture pack ) . finally if you want to share your texture pack with others , you can either give them the folder or you can compress everything inside into a zip file . then others can simply place the folder or zip file into their texturepacks directory .
at the higher difficulties , i have found that the only way to win is to play defensively . siege units , at least one in each city , probably flanked with another siege unit ( or two on a border with an aggressive enemy ) and some front line infantry is really the only protection . my second city is almost always founded in an area with a lot of production bonuses ( hills , iron , stone/marble , horses/cows/sheep , etc ) and focuses completely on producing military for the entire game . if you grow large enough , founding an additional city of this type can be useful , but if you have got around half a dozen cities or less , one is generally sufficient . have this city crank out units and only build military buildings there ( ideally by rushing them , if you have got the cash ) . most of the rest of the empire is money- and happiness- focused , although they might churn out disposable units if war is looking inevitable or going poorly . when it comes to science , pick techs that get you closer to : money production buildings , like the bank better siege units ( trebuchet , cannon , and especially artillery ) better front line infantry ( musketmen , infantry , mech . inf . , etc ) the ai will become increasingly aggressive towards you if they feel your military power is less than theirs . however , they are terrible military strategists . they will send their entire army right to your cities , with no regards to how that leaves their defenses or how positioning effects their chances at survival . at the higher levels of difficulty , this can mean an almost constant trickle of units . however , they tend to fail to prepare for the bonuses you gain for fighting on your own turf - take these whenever possible , and then turtle heavily when they declare war . after a while , you will have an army of extremely powerful units ( ie , 2-shot per turn siege units with extra combat range , etc ) and great generals , which you can use to push the tide back . plan on cranking out front line infantry units , as they are somewhat disposable . put a large priority on preserving your high-level siege units , though . likewise , if you see a weak neighbor , go after their stuff . the ai gets big bonuses to production , so their cities are going to be better equipped than ones you could found yourself . declare war , turtle for a few turns while they bumble about ineffectually at your borders , and then steamroll . just remember not to completely abandon your own defenses . . .
after a couple rolling crashes and a nights sleep , i think i have a solution : a blimp probe . it will cruise around just above ground level , and then land on a flat spot in a kethane field . then i will use it is coordinates as a target for landing the mining operation . that will obviously only work on planets with an atmosphere . for planets without an atmosphere , a possible solution would be to swing down in an elliptical orbit to an extremely low altitude , with a pitch of 0° . i could take screenshots with the camera facing almost perfectly downwards , with the surface coordinates showing . then i could analyze the photos and pick a location with a landmark to guide a very small marker probe down . if all goes well , i land the mining operation at the probe 's coordinates . if it does not , i return the probe to the orbiter , refuel it , and try again .
gems are useful for smithing , as they increase the skill by quite a bit . they can be smithed into jewelry which can then be enchanted with properties that buff certain attributes ( fortify light armor , extra sneaking or lockpicking percentage , etc ) . also , some gems are used during quests . for example , there is an argonian in riften who will ask you to find three flawless amethysts so that he can make a wedding ring for his lover . as you mentioned , they can also be sold for a fair amount of gold . keep in mind though that gemmed jewelry is more costly than just gems alone . if it is money you are after crafting jewelry and selling that would be more advantageous than selling the gems alone .
augmentations are permanent . there is no way to re-spend your praxis points short of starting a new playthrough . ( but let 's be honest : why would not you want a 2nd playthrough ! ) technically , according to the game , you start play with every augment , and praxis points only represent knowledge that helps you " turn on " the various augmentations* . unlike in the original game , there is no exclusive choice when it comes to augmentations . you can get as many as you like -- as long as you have the praxis to pay for it . *according to a scene early in the game , part of the post-augmentation period is what allows the brain to fully integrate with the augmentations . that is to say , the augments kick in automatically , after they interact with the brain for enough time . in a word , that abstraction is the reason you are gaining " xp " and " levels " . each level ( and the praxis point it brings ) represents jensen having spent enough time to " naturally " unlock the dormant augmentation . praxis kits , are objects that let you side-step the " natural " process , and directly download information to tell the brain how to use it .
you will find grenades lying around , similar to ammo . they are shiny and round and here 's a screenshot .
yes there is one in the wiki : the exact wording for the fireside friends quest is : play 3 matches against other players on the same subnet , with at least 3 players total on that subnet . the maximum amount of packs from reaper of souls that can be redeemed to a single account is 5 . " ready to rock ! " and " beta hero ! " are no longer available .
torches can be found in various places around the game world as items . in addition , enemies that carry torches ( there is one on one of the bridges in the hunters copse , and a few more in the gutter , to name a couple of places ) have a high chance of dropping a torch upon death .
i do not know for sure , but for every one of mine that is gold i have gathered every treasure in that chapter .
once you take over the keep it technically changes into a different zone . for instance before it is your stronghold it is ar1300: de'arnise keep outdoor then after you make it your stronghold it is ar1304: de'arnise keep outdoor ( stronghold ) this should explain the problem . in short , yes you are hosed unless you want to replay the area or cheat the item in and pretend it never happened . sorry !
four : the one who dies because of the virmire choice and thane , as well as legion and either wrex or mordin . everyone else can be saved . liara , james , and edi are easiest to save , as there is no opportunity for them to die . next is the virmire survivor , as after that , they will live through the next two games , provided you can charm/intimidate at the proper moment in mass effect 3 . then comes wrex . between mass effect 1 and 2 , he can only die on virmire , but is easily saved with charm/intimidate . then comes your mass effect 2 squad mates . any who are not loyal will likely parish in the suicide mission . loyalty automatically grants them a magic character shield for mass effect 3 , excepting thane , who was not expected to live past the suicide mission due to his illness anyway . some of your other mass effect 2 squad mates can also die in mass effect 3 , despite the character shield , but it is usually fairly easy to save them . mordin can be saved during priority : tuchanka , but it means sacrificing wrex a little later . either tali or legion will commit suicide during the priority : rannoch mission . legion , through disseminating his upgraded processes , or tali , due to the quarians being slaughtered by the geth ( in which case legion will already be dead from the upload ) . legion may also become violent , in which case , you will be forced to kill him . unlike tali and mordin , there is no way for legion to survive priority:rannoch .
you can reset your team fortress 2 statistics by opening your character loadout , then navigate to the stats tab and click the reset stats button .
the following conditions will greatly impact on npcs stance towards you . vampirism vampires are hated and feared by the general population and will be attacked on sight if their true nature is discovered . stage three vampirism : most npcs will not interact with you if you initiate the conversation . stage four vampirism : nearly all npcs become hostile and will attack on sight , including spouses and followers . lycanthropy - beast form almost all npcs will become hostile ( exceptions include other werewolves , maiq the liar , melka , members of the dark brotherhood , paarthurnax , followers , housecarls , and members of the thieves guild [ verification needed ] , but not your spouse , unless your spouse is one of these ) note : you have to choose to be either a vampire or a werewolf . high bounty comitting any crime causes the hold guards to attack you . bounty collector if your bounty is above 1000 gold , you may be met by a bounty collector . sacred chickens there are consequences for killing a chicken . even though the bounty is as low as 45 , the townsfolk will kill the violator if they get the chance . sheathing the weapon has no effect on hold guards . you better run . source for some reason chickens are for skyrim what cows are for indians . not delicious but sacred .
it is entirely possible to complete the entire tower within the event period , though it requires a high amount of activity ( beyond just using up hp before it overflows ) . you need to : keep farming for magatamas with sealstone completions , so that you have a source of 4* mags to level up newly obtained daemons advance through the tower only , using up hp before it overflows ( i.e. . fills up and you waste time ) , without trying to investigate in story mode aim to reserve fuse materials so that you can get the 150f daemon to a very high level , as it often has a skill to reduce the defense of 200th floor guardian ghost thus , the highest floor reachable would be 200 and highest guardian possible is the 5* top guardian ghost . however , note that the top wandering ghosts have a far higher defense and need much more preparation time before you can attempt them ( as a free player ) . update : tower mechanics have changed since this answer was posted , it is no longer possible to complete a tower without hp increasing items ( candy , remedy or nectar ) - which can be acquired by free players over time , but will not be enough as a new player .
just create the folder . as of minecraft 1.6 the actual game no longer uses a bin folder and therefore does not create one , but some few mods still use it . creating it yourself will be no different than if minecraft created it for you .
the camera in kingdom hearts 1 was one of the primary complaints by players . in kh1 , the camera is controlled with l2 and r2 and centering the camera behind sora was hitting both at the same time . in kh2 , they reworked the camera so the right analog stick controls the camera . this makes it much easier to control looking around , is quicker , and is much more familiar . in addition to this , clicking in the right analog stick centers the camera , and hitting r2 toggles the camera between automatic and manual control mode . so if you get annoyed with the camera auto centering , just hit r2 . overall , the camera will get mostly out of your way in kh 2 . at the very least , it is a vast improvement over the first games controls .
let 's do some experiments ! i am going to assume we are interested in making square holes , for several reasons : it is easier to measure and compare that way . you probably want flat walls . if you find a good blast pattern , you can do the same thing side-by-side to clear a larger area in multiples of the pattern without wasting any blast power . i am also going to ignore the possibility of encountering a vein of dirt or gravel , which is much easier to blast and results in much less predictability of the results due to irregular obscured shape . that 3×3×3 cube fact is true , but only if the tnt is actually fully encased — which would be a waste of time since you would have to light the tnt and then plug the hole . the way i have used tnt to dig is to make a 3-deep hole and place tnt at the bottom of it ( or drop lit tnt down from the top , which requires less careful cursor work ) . in addition to blowing out the cube , it will also take out nearly all of the fourth layer above ( say , with one block remaining ) . i have found this to be a very convenient strategy . in this case , each tnt will blow up 3×3×4 - 3 - 1 = 32 blocks , and 4 ( 11% ) were removed by hand . suppose we place a single tnt on a flat stone surface and ignite it . i did this and got a 7×1×7 hole where the outside was only partly exploded , leaving 12-15 blocks [ 3 trials ] . 7 × 7 - 14 = 35 blocks , and you will want to clear the remaining 14 ( 28% ) by hand since they are irregularly shaped so a blast would be wasteful . how about the same as above but with the tnt inset into the ground by 1 block ? that turns out to be the same as the first case without the blocks above , so it removes only 9+8 = 17 blocks . let 's go higher . placing a tnt on top of some leaves ( blast resistance = 1 ) results in another 7×7 pattern , but with only 9 blocks left unexploded . another block higher and there are many more blocks remaining ; i will stop here for now and assume this direction is not useful . so , the on-the-surface configuration blasts more area , but surely it wastes all that blast going sideways and upward . let 's try setting off a tnt in the center of a 3×3×4 hole produced by the first method ( supporting the tnt with a block of leaves ) . whee ! the second blast nearly perfectly enlarged the cube , leaving only 4 corner pieces . that means we destroyed 5×5×5 - 4 = 121 blocks , or 60.5 per tnt , with 3 + 4 = 7 blocks ( 6% ) to clear by hand . a third tnt , supported 2 spaces above with 1 block of leaves , after clearing the irregularities , resulted in an irregular 7×7×6 hole with 52 blocks left in it , meaning 7×7×6 - 52 - 7 = 235 blocks = 78.3̅ per tnt were destroyed . this is an excellent efficiency , but notice that the amount of hand-work has gone up to 59 blocks ( 20% ) . a fourth centered blast , after clearing the irregularities , only scarred the walls a bit ; i am not going to bother working out the numbers . in conclusion , based on the patterns i have tried , the most efficient pattern ( in terms of blocks exploded per block of tnt ) is three blasts at the same center point , starting with a 3-deep hole in the ground , manually smoothing off the walls between each step . ( however , these tests were conducted in creative mode , so i did not concern myself with safety ( i.e. . getting out of the hole ) . the temporary stairs required to exit after the second and third setups may affect the patterns ; or you could use a water stream or drop lit tnt from a frame above . ) on the other hand , if you want to minimize manual effort while making a square hole , then i recommend using two blasts , as that has the lowest manual work percentage while still being quite efficient in tnt . my experimental setup was a flat stone surface with a surrounding 11×11 obsidian ring to aid counting and provide a height reference in case i blew up all the surface . shown here is the situation immediately after the fourth blast discussed above . also , thanks for asking this question ! i have learned an improvement to my own blasting technique .
i seriously doubt it . lightning reeds do about half damage compared to a peashooter . camel zombies have twice the hitpoints of basic zombies . in my experience , an unimpeded basic zombie travels a little over 3 squares in the time it takes a peashooter to kill it . so , a basic zombie should be able to travel around 6 squares while taking damage from a single lightning reed , and a camel zombie should be able to travel at least 12 squares while taking damage from a single lightning reed . as there are only 9 squares in a column , i do not think the lightning reed will be able to defeat the camel zombies .
only the rune you choose is the active rune , and you get only its benefits . so you need to choose between the different bonuses . in your example , only rune #4 will give you benefits . just as before you did not get the bonuses from rune #1 and only from rune #2 . many times runes collide . logically you can not have a rune that increases the damage of the power together with a rune that causes several weaker shots of that power .
bamboo shoots grow to become bamboo . they carry no fruit ( and certainly not bells ) , but they do work well for decoration purposes and reproduce quite quickly . when bamboo has grown , it will periodically create new shoots that get buried around it . these shoots will plant themselves if left unattended , but can also be sold or used as food .
there are a few things that you can do to reduce the cost of screwing up . the first thing to do is to quicksave often ( defaults to f5 , load the last quicksave by holding f9 ) . this means that you can get your ship into kerbal orbit ( quicksave ) , do your transfer burn ( quicksave ) , do your munar injection burn ( quicksave ) , and then your deorbit burn ( quicksave ) without worrying about having to redo the entire mission . if you want to practice landing , then just try to land , and then load the last quicksave , which should be just after your deorbit burn . note that there is only a single quicksave available per save , and if you load it , and it is too old , you are basically stuck with it , unless you catch it quickly enough . the second option is to create tutorial/scenario saves . these use the same savefile format as the rest of the game , but also include end goals . i am not familiar with steps required to create them , but i have tried some community generated ones in the past . take a look through kerbal spaceport , the forums , and the ksp subreddit for any that you think will fit the bill . your final option is save editing . skip the drudgery of launch and just place your lander directly into munar orbit ! scott manley has done a video all about editing your save to do fun and interesting stuff , or to save some time . there may be some other options available to you as well , but with these three methods , you should be able to do plenty of practice while also completing missions .
yes : junk is just that . you can safely sell it all .
this sounds like adventure zones will be exactly what you are looking for : craglorn will be the first adventure zone offering content for grouped players . they will introduce the so far hardest content in the game in the form of so-called trials , which will be encounters for groups of up to twelve players . there is also some kind of leaderboards ( time based ) , so you can compare your own performance to that of others if you really want to . those encounters will not last that long , but you can repeat them at any time and they will have randomly picked enemies , so it is not like you have got the same content over and over again . besides that , if you are into pvp , i bet that the alliance war would be something for you . it is a lot more dynamic than classic pve raids and it will always offer you different challenges , different enemies , etc . as an example , have a look at angry joe 's pvp impressions : you can do pvp alone or in a group - it is your choice and you will never know what you are up against next ( so if you like challenges , you can try to take on larger forces with your group and make yourself a name ) .
based on this forum post asking for a bonus for honoring all the graves , it looks like there is currently no benefit .
as of the 1.04 patch on 8/21/2012 , each party member gets their own magic find and gold find value applied to the items that drop for them . prior to 1.04 , magic find in a party was averaged between party members . so if you had a 4 person party , one had 40% , one had 20% , and the other two had none , everyone would have an effective magic find of 15% for their own drops . the same thing applies to gold find bonuses and bonuses to xp . for single player with a follower , you get your own value , plus 20% of the bonuses on your follower 's gear . source
when you select a shield to deploy in the upgrade-menu , it actually shows you their different parameters ( just like for resonators it shows how much the range would increase iff deployed ) . the values for the shields are : common - mitigation 22 ( +6 ) rare - mitigation 22 ( +8 ) very rare - mitigation 22 ( +10 ) of course it is a different matter to figure out how those values relate to burst-absorption .
there is no way to enable battle animations in online play . you need to look out for a mod .
throw enough candies ( 1630 ) on the ground and the guy ( . _ . ) will dig a hole ( because he gets annoyed by your candy wasting ) . he falls into a room that contains something . a chocolate bar around 2000 candies ( 1770 ) , he digs into another room . in this room , there are giant candies . he stays in the room and keeps eating them . he does not do anything else after that , just eating those giant candies .
the solution from various other sites that has been going around : make sure you do not send the gold you earned for the item to your stash . open up a chat console , type a message to anyone ( even party if there is no-one in your party ) , shift and click the little icon next to the gold amount ( same as when you are linking your friends to your items in your inv ) , it will show the item you sold as a link in the console which you can click on and see the stats of . as of the 1.04 patch , it should be possible to just mouse over the item in your completed window to see its stats .
so , the damage stat on the character sheet represents an estimate of dps , but it factors in a number of stats , including some that you do not see clearly elsewhere on the character sheer . first off , it factors in the bonus to damage from your characters primary stat . we will refer to that as s from here on out . s is a multiplier equal to your strength , dexterity , or intellect as appropriate . s = 214 ( primary attribute ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &times ; 1% ( bonus damage per point ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; + 1 ( base ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; = 3.14 next , it accounts for your chance to get a critical strike , as well as the magnitude of bonus damage gained from crits . we will call this c . because we are accounting for the average amount of damage gained from crits , we can just multiply the crit damage by the crit bonus ( as percentages ) to get the multiplier . my demon hunter does not have any gear or talents that modify her crit chance or damage , so that makes the math here easy . c = 5% ( chance to crit ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &times ; 50% ( bonus damage on crit ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; + 1 &nbsp ; &nbsp ; = 1.025 next , it accounts for weapon speed . we will call this r for ' rate of fire ' . this includes any modifiers that increase your attack speed , such as the bonus earned for dual wielding , or from having a quiver equipped in the case of my demon hunter , i have a quiver , and an amulet that provide a combined 17% bonus to my bows base attack speed of 1.4 . fortunately , we do not have to do any math here . the character sheet flat tells me : r = 1.64 now we come to the big one . average damage , which will abbreviate as a in our formula . what we want here is the average damage done by every single shot . this includes bonuses such as those from the two rings of wounding ( +2-4 damage each in my case ) , and the amulet of wounding ( +3-6 damage in my case ) that my demon hunter is wearing . so we take the base damage range of 8-41 , and add on two bonuses of 2-4 , and another of 3-6 . we can just add all the minimum and maximum numbers together here , to get 15-55 . remember not to include elemental damage bonuses that are on your weapon - these are already included in the weapons damage range as displayed ! average the two to find a . dual wielders , remember to apply all the appropriate bonuses to both weapons - you will be averaging four numbers if you have two weapons . a = ( 55 + 15 ) / 2 &nbsp ; &nbsp ; = 35 finally , you multiply this by any other percentage modifiers that you might have from talents . we can call these m . my demon hunter does not have any of these as i am set up right now , but if i were to use the archer talent , that'd be a 15% bonus , making ( m = 1.15 ) then we just do some multiplication ! damage = scram 3.14 &times ; 1.025 &times ; 1.64 &times ; 35 = 184.74 we can account for the discrepancy because we took the character sheets word for the weapon speed stat , rather than calculating out the +17% modifier there ourselves . if , instead of using 1.64 , we calculate out the weapon speed ourselves , we get r = 1.638 , and then we see our expected result : 184.52 now , it is important to note that , among other things , this number does not tell you how hard your abilities will hit . what it does give you a ballpark for is , if you fire off the same ability constantly , how much damage will you do ? but what if you do want to know how hard evasive shot will hit ? after all , it does 125% of weapon damage . but what does that mean ? well , we can use our existing variables - we just need to remove c and r from the equation - c is still helpful for getting an idea of how much damage ten evasive shots will do , and r will tell us how fast we can fire them off - both important if we want to know how much damage we can do spamming evasive shot , but to know how hard an individual ability will hit , you can use this formula : ability damage = same where e is the percentage modifier applied to your weapon damage by the ability . for evasive shot , e = 1.25 so , in the case of my evasive shot , i can expect it to hit for an average of 137 damage . so , what is the takeaway from all of this for you ? should you care about maximizing the ' damage ' stat on the character sheet ? the short answer is , for most players in most situations , yes . you can rely on the '+ damage ' comparison tooltip to tell you whether something is an upgrade . the primary edge case where you might need to pay close attention to this is if you get a lot of your damage from an ability that you can not or do not use very often - if you can not spam an ability , r becomes much less important to you , and you should take into account that while the character sheet looks at the rate of fire , you might not care about it so much . in these cases , doing the math yourself might tell you that a slightly lower dps weapon is better - if it hits hard enough to make up for the difference .
you cannot craft arrows , however . . . you can farm them , either from some imperials practicing archery in solitude , or from thieves guild member cynric endell doing the same in the ragged flagon . with dawnguard dlc now with dawnguard dlc you can actualy craft arrow from a forge with blacksmith skills . most of the time you will need 1x Firewood 1x Material (Iron, Dragonbone, Ebony, etc)  example for a daedric arrow you will need 1x Firewoord 1x Ebony Ingot 1x Daedric Heart  so it is now possible to craft arrows if you have the right dlc installed .
one of the things you can do is show it to maul , the nord who accosts you when you first enter riften . he will direct you to vex , in the thieves guild , who starts the next quest , no stone unturned . you cannot access vex without joining the thieves guild , so if you are interested in completing the quest , you will have to join up .
no , this is not true for all levels . using less birds is only more efficient if the amount of damage done by each additional bird will net you less than 10 000 points , the amount of score you get for each bird not used . for instance , pig bang 1-14 can be completed with only one bird , but to get three stars you would need to use all three to cause the maximum amount of damage , as per my answer here : stackexchange-url

according to the prima guide , you have to spent " a lot of money " at re-tail before he will wake up during the day . once he does , though , he will be able to help you customize your furniture . he can also take a complete dinosaur skeleton set and make it into a miniature model according to the animal crossing wiki , which gives more detail about the specifics than the guide does , the player must first sell 100,000 bells worth of items to reese , have owned 100 different furniture pieces and have 50 different clothing items in their catalog . they must also have been in the town for over 7 days . once these pre-requisites have been fulfilled , cyrus will be available .
herobrine was a fictional character that was said to ' haunt ' minecraft . people would fake screenshots saying he followed them into caves or whatever . he was said to be notch 's dead brother ( who does not exist ) . with the mod that allows you to bring fake npcs into the game , it became more common to put fake herobrines into the game . he does not exist and is a joke . this was notch 's response - trolling . there is a ton of backstory and stuff here .
in minecraft beta 1.4 and later , sleeping in a bed will set your spawn point . on older smp servers running minecraft beta 1.3 , spawn points can be changed using the /setspawn command , provided the server is running any of the common mods to provide this functionality . sometimes this command is called /sethome , and sometimes the /sethome command has a different purpose . there is no way to set the spawn point ingame on single player minecraft alpha/beta &lt ; 1.4 . some third party tools will change it for you however . for minecraft classic , pressing enter sets the spawn point .
readiness is managed via the galaxy at war system and i will go into the specific ways to earn readiness below : single player war assets are the part of galaxy at war you collect in single player . simply purchase war assets with in game money to earn varying amounts of readiness , rated by military strength . the wiki pages list the military strength of the various war assets . some assets require certain conditions to be earned . war assets are not readiness , but instead their effect ( military strength ) is multiplied by readiness . multiplayer playing multiplayer earns you various rewards that increase galactic readiness , such as promoting a character to level 20 or simply completing missions . failure ( any mission of any level ) : 3% readiness bronze mission ( success ) : 4% readiness mass effect : infiltrator this ios game will help you increase galactic readiness if you link the games . from ea 's press release , via cult of mac : inspired by the deep and immersive mass effect 3 universe , in infiltrator players will help to free prisoners from a hostile cerberus base and will receive rewards for collecting evidence of cerberus’ crimes along the way . every completed rescue and intelligence discovery in infiltrator will increase a player’s galactic readiness rating directly through the galaxy at war system in mass effect 3 . it is now available for android as well : north america and everywhere else . mass effect datapad datapad is a free ios app that will allow you to monitor your galactic readiness and a minigame which will allow you to slowly increase it . from the galactic readiness map you can send select 3 different mission points within each sector which can earn up to a 1% readiness boost for that sector only . it takes anywhere from 1 hour to 6 hours to earn a point . you can increase this by getting various power-ups based on points earned playing .
they show how many bitizens are working in their dream job .
i checked i missed out the charge vigour during the game . at the last stage i found it selling for 250$ in the vigour vending machine so yes they do sell it . if you happen to see a vigour skills in shop and you do not have it means your are able to buy it from the shop .
no , nidalee loses the buff after using her ultimate to change back into human .
clickers have an odd shaped head and make a clicking noise . they also stumble or limp when they walk . runners walk more normally and appear more human .
the wiki appears to say that an alchemy machine can be used to prototype everything that the science machine can : the science machine is used to unlock tier 1 items , and the alchemy engine is used to unlock tier 1 and tier 2 items , making the alchemy engine the higher level prototyping machine . i believe i have seen this for myself , standing by my alchemy machine and prototyping tier 1 technology . therefore , you should be able to destroy your science machine with no negative effects .
the developers of the game played the other springfield . it is not so much of an ai as it is a pre-programmed series of events . this is why there are versions of it that are available at various levels . source
ets 2 has a file contains info about levels . here is fragment of that file : it is easy to conclude that after level 50 your name of rank will stay the same . and the maximum level , according this long file , is 150 ( but i can not say for sure if any new patch changed that , it is confirmed after patch 1.2.5 ) .
if you take a look at the bottom of the log file , you can notice that the game is having continuous rendering errors , most likely caused by the oil . rendering this oil is using up a lot of memory , and even making the game run out of memory , as you can see is happening in your log , at this line : ( and a few lines below this ) try turning off the liquid animations , and possibly lower other graphics settings . if this still does not work , the best thing to do is to contact the mod developers at the ftb support site . this lets the developers know so that they can fix the error .
it is intentional , does happen in smp , and cannot be disabled on a vanilla server as far as i know . on a bukkit server , the disableit plugin can disable any type of explosion , including beds . in the nether , there basically is no time of day &mdash ; bring a watch with you and see what happens . the beds only let you sleep in them when it is night time , and this lack of time apparently confuses them to the point of spontaneous explosion . sleeping in the nether has never worked , but before beta 1.6 the beds were neither sentient nor quite as explosive ; you had simply get the " you can only sleep at night " message . of course , this is not really appropriate for the nether , since it is never night . notch likely wanted to make it more obvious to players that beds do not work in the nether at all . why explosions ? i am not sure , but it certainly drives the point home , does not it ? possibly evil notch had a hand in this .
yes , moss stone occurs naturally in smp . it can only be found on dungeons walls . the quantity varies , but my friend got around 55 blocks with only one dungeon , playing in smp of beta 1.5 . the minimum seems to be 30 blocks , with a maximum of 64 per dungeon . dungeon , with part of the floor composed of moss stone : source of some information : http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/moss_stone
there is no benefit really , it is just to show how many games you have played and/or completed . i have seen people as high as 15 on mine ( i am at 12 now ) .
i have observed that from having 0% templar awareness , it takes 5 high-profile kills ( where guards see you make the kill ) to get it to fill up 1/8 the way ( to the corner of the meter ) . janissaries are worth two normal kills . that would equate to 40 high-profile kills to get to 100% templar awareness . renovations add 20% to your awareness taking 5 renovations to get to 100% templar awareness . by my calculations : murder : 40 kills/ 100% awareness renovations : 5 renovations/ 100% awareness murder-to-renovation ratio : 40 kills/ 5 renovations == 8 kills/ 1 renovation == 8.0
i have played a lot of mmos and i have come to a conclusion that i find reinforced with each new game : the crafting that has the best bang for your buck is whatever is involved in making consumables . so in lotro that is the historian . i do not find the weaponsmithing so useful--largely because of the cost of the ingredients versus what user-crafted stuff sells for--but the farmer and scholar can both rely on selling their stuff at the auction house without much trouble . for example , each weekly batch of master-level athelas/celebrant potions i make cost me less than 200s but frequently bring in 1g ( or more ) at the ah with barely any effort on my part . and if i am willing to make lower-level stuff--the oils for arrows in particular seem to sell well--then i can make even more money . but i find a quick and easy 1g a week more than pays for my efforts . the tinker is probably the second best profession in light of the various tokens he can make , which are always needed for instances . and of all the items the various professions can make , it seems to me that i regularly sell high-end jewelry more easily than high-end armor , weapons , etc .
its a random encounter for you to get to know there is an assassins guild in the game . it happens always early in the game ( so its somewhat scripted ) and later you get the option to join them or destroy them . the player never gets to know who wanted you dead and you cant ask any of the dark brotherhood about it . its not really that important .
the day in-game is the same as the current real-world day of the week , assuming your system clock is set properly on your ds .
there is a guide on gamefaqs . there seem to be some heavy spoilers , so just a small snippet it is true that you can use everyone 's lovable suikoden 1 hero in suikoden 2 . and , if you play your cards right , you can even see gremio as well . you must have suikoden 1 to even attempt this . there are some things you need to take care of first in suikoden 1 however . the thing that is definitely required is your saved game must be at the last save point in gregminster before you battle the golden hydra .
this was a very frustrating battle . the trick about the targeting laser is that it does not actually require you to complete the targeting lock in a single fire . you can completely let go of the trigger and run to the side , then re-aim , making increments of progress each time . the other thing i noticed , which was non-obvious to me the first several times i died in the final slow motion sequence , was that the targeting seemed to work much more quickly if your aim was as close as possible to the center of the red eye ( not just " am i in the blue target circle ? " ) . i have not replayed to confirm with science™ that this is indeed true , but on my successful completion i made sure to aim dead center and it was all over very quickly .
best suggestion i can give is play some games , if you are afraid of loosing ranked matches at start then play custom games that do not count towards your placement or custom games that are made for practicing certain aspects of the game like " multitasking train " or build order tester . other than that you should read up on changes and new tactics since you last played , trying all maps in the map pool might also be a good idea if you do not want to loose in the beginning and watch videos/streams of other players so you see what people do . just remember in the long run your are expected to loose about 50% of your matches as long as there is people that are better than you do to the way the matching system works . to your 2nd question you can check that on your quick match screen , if your still got some kind of placement it will say " play one match to be placed in a new division for this season . " if not it will say " complete a series of multiplayer matches to determine your initial league placement . " and it will say how many games are remaning .
it is hard to answer this question generically . display " mode persistence " , as it is called in the biz , is a notoriously fickle and config dependent feature . key factors to consider : display mode ( clone , or extended desktop ) graphics adapter ( nvidia , ati , etc ) version of windows ( generally pre-win 7 or post-win 7 ) display modes are handled differently for these different configs . i would also suspect that the fps hit for running in these different configs varies . all that said , if you want an easy way to turn off your second ( or third/fourth etc ) displays , most modern graphics cards provide it . look for a " hotkey " menu in the graphics adapter gui . for example in catalyst : here you can set keystrokes for various display mode switching . i believe you had be looking for " disable all non-primary displays " . there many other hotkey-able capabilities you may also find useful , if you are switching between gaming and " regular " computer use .
it is based on the individual level of each game element . here are a couple of examples ( not in any particular order , as i have not written down at this point at which level each system is unlocked for research ) ; sound basic sound , mono sound , stereo sound , surround sound , soundtrack , orchestral soundtrack dialogue better dialogue , branching dialogue , dialogue trees , voice overs , celebrity voice acting , immersive story telling the exception to this is the graphical engines , which are unlocked and need to be researched individually without maxing out the previous graphical engine . the amount of experience you get for each game element per game created is influenced by the positioning of the slider and elements used in a particular game . the experience is given at the end of the development process and you will still get the experience regardless of whether you release or trash the game .
in many cases , yes . there is no " save screenshot to sd card " feature in the 3ds as of right now . some games allow you to take pictures under certain conditions ( the camera man in pokémon xy , the camera in pilotwings resort , pressing l + r in animal crossing new leaf , etc . ) , but this differs from game to game . with the miiverse , however ( which was added to 3ds in a firmware update ) , you can post whatever is on screen at the time if that particular game has a miiverse community ( and you are able to bring up the home menu , of course ) - and then only in that particular community . after posting a screenshot on miiverse , you can then access the image via wii u , 3ds or the miiverse site .
for the purposes of the game code , the death counter increments if and only if a death occurs . in other words , you do not count as having died if you are immediately revived . you lose buffs if you die . if you do not die , you do not lose buffs . yasuo 's q stacks are counted as buffs . thus , guardian angel and chronoshift will preserve yasuo 's q stacks .
kinect voice can not be used to play videos/music ( dvds or xbox media library ) . project natal had its own cpu , kinect does not . this means there will never be turn on voice command or gesture . kinect can not be used on the dashboard . also voice cant be used on netflix in sum , basically everything you see in project natal videos is what you can not do . it is pretty cool just it could be a hell of a lot better .
i do not think so . i also had the save game issue after the patch but i loaded a game in the hyperion and it was good . used a lot of saves , i actually fell about a couple attacks short of getting the hard achievement for " a sinister turn " so i loaded an autosave and finished the mission from there ( and got the achievement also )
no there is not . the only stats you will find are the ones on battlelog , and they are very lackluster . it is one of the main complaints that hopefully dice has noticed and will fix .
tl ; dr : on normal , scarlett 's and torgue 's campaigns are supposed to be taken alongside the main quest , at any point since level 15 . hammerlock 's and tina 's - after the main quest . on tvhm and uvhm - any campaign at any point . campaign dlcs scale to player 's level when you first visit them , but with restrictions in normal and tvhm . these are : normal : captain scarlett and her pirate 's booty - levels 15 to 30 . mr . torgue 's campaign of carnage - levels 15 to 30 . sir hammerlock 's big game hunt - levels 30 to 35 . tiny tina 's assault on dragon keep - levels 30 to 35 . true vault hunter mode : all dlc scales up to level 50 . upper bounds is what i observe when returning my level 50 from tvhm . lower bounds are what i see when jumping there with a level 8 character . big game hunt and dragon keep are the ones definitely designed to be taken after the main quest - other two are actually a breeze if you are level 33-34 after the main quest , and especially when you complete them at 36-38 . side note : mr . torgue 's campaign of carnage is not similar to mad moxxi 's underdome riot - it is not a ladder of lots of rounds on a few arenas . it is what underdome should have been - a full-sized quest line built around a tournament and several arena ( and non-arena ) battles ( and non-battles ) .
the uesp wiki , ' quest timing ' article has a detailed list of quests ( and notes about those quests ) that will have a significant impact on other quests and the game , in general . some of them are due to bugs , and some are because they are designed to be that way . it also recommends if a quest has to be done early or be postponed before/until another quest has been finished or another game event has happened , to prevent bugs or a negative impact on other quests , or the game . the whole article is too big to be included here . i will be adding some of the most notable quest categories and the quests under those categories related to your question : quests to do as soon as possible blood on the ice why : the necromancer amulet is a legendary-quality item very useful for low-level spellcasting characters , especially those interested in conjuration , and can be sold for a lot of gold for a low-level character . there are numerous glitches associated with this quest , and the best fix is to start the quest as soon as possible and complete it all at once . the forsworn conspiracy and no one escapes cidhna mine notes : . . . if you side with the stormcloaks in the civil war and if you complete forsworn conspiracy before compelling tribute and then wait until after compelling tribute to start cidhna mine , it will become unavailable permanently . it is also possible to have the same effect result from completing forsworn conspiracy , then completing season unending before cidhna mine , even if you have not joined the stormcloaks . quests to save for later dragon rising why : completing this quest early ensures a large number of dragon souls by exploring , if the player is capable of surviving the dragon 's attacks . why not : after completing this quest , skyrim will be full of dragons . deferring it until you are in the mood to fight dragons lets you explore the world in relative peace and allows you to learn words from dragon lairs more easily . note that starting the quest will not cause dragons to appear ; only after killing mirmulnir will dragons start spawning . joining the stormcloaks or joining the legion why not : joining either the stormcloaks or the legion removes access to all the opposing faction 's camps and causes " random encounter " fights to occur . capturing towns has been known to break certain quests . quests that conflict lost to the ages ( dawnguard dlc ) and mourning never comes why : during lost to the ages , you are required to trek through raldbthar , where alain dufont lives . if you kill him before starting mourning never comes , you cannot kill nilsine shatter-shield for the bonus reward in that quest . why not : alain only becomes hostile if you attack him , he will not defend the other bandits in the area . you can kill all the bandits but alain , and complete lost to the ages without affecting mourning never comes . also , mourning never comes is only available if you choose to join the dark brotherhood ; if you choose to destroy them , you will never be given it .
you can do it , but it is not terribly cheap . you need something like this : http://www.amazon.com/pyle-pypbhd40-component-converter-support/dp/b0038p58hy the plug in the first answer will not get you there ; it is for specific video cards that are capable of putting out component analog signals on particular pins on the dvi connector . you can not turn component video into dvi or hdmi with a passive adapter , since you have to convert the image from analog to digital . edit : if your monitor takes only digital and will not take analog vga on some of the dvi pins , i do not think the wii -> vga -> dvi adapter route is going to help you either . there are vga -> dvi converter boxes like the one above that take in analog vga and put out digital dvi , but the ones i know of are super-expensive since they can handle much higher resolutions than your wii 's going to put out .
just needed to check a bit . . . anyways , in the new version of pixelmon , 2.5.2 , ( and even 2.5 ) cyndaquil is made a starter . and for pidgeot . . . pidgeot has apparently already existed , as it evolves from pidgeotto . i saw these both in a pixelmon 2.5 introduction video and the pixelmon wiki at pixelmon.wikia.com.
let 's sum up what we got . possible reasons : battery fault . snes fault ( for some reason erases saves randomly ) . cartridge fault ( memory chip corruption ) . so that is that you can do : be sure you replaced battery nice and correctly . try other games , and see if their saves are not lost . try cartridge on some other snes console and see if it fails there .
well , apparently enter works for " unit needs orders " and " next turn " , but have not found one for " choose research " or " choose production " .
* spoiler alert * there are layers of mystery in this game that have survived so long because of how challenging it is and how few people beat it , so while i will not disclose everything i could , the answer to this question will still spoil mysteries for players that have not progressed very far in the game . the final stat you have not discovered yet is . . . consecutive air parries you can perform a parry by hitting the arrow key facing an enemy or enemy projectile that is about to hit you . so if you are about to touch an enemy from the right side , you have to hit the left arrow key right before he would otherwise kill you . ( only left/right matters , not top/bottom . try visually dividing the enemy in half vertically . ) if you are successful , the enemy will freeze in place for a few seconds and will not harm you . this precision of this move is quite challenging , so it is no surprise if have not encountered it yet . if you have , getting two in a row without touching the ground is even more difficult . a white later , when you are close to beating the game , you will uncover a new secret that lets you do an even more advanced move following a parry , making it easier to achieve consecutive air parries . this advanced tactic is required to beat many of the challenge levels ( 111-120 ) , which are only unlocked after beating every other level with rainbow flower times . as i am sure you have discovered , when you are close enough to the rainbow time ( often within a 3 or so seconds ) you will see the ghost of a ninja beating you to the finish line . this is the replay of the dev time that you must beat , and watching it will often reveal new tricks and strategies required to approach dev times on other levels .
okay , i think i figured it out through trial and error and some experimentation with save files . once you step on the plate at the start of level 7 , the grate at the start of level 6 will raise and you can get back to the higher levels . notice that merely visiting level 7 through the basement stairs or falling through pits is not sufficient to raise the grate at the start of level 6 .
as of now ( and it seems quite likely for a while ) no , you can not , but there are things you can do : -you can make the schedule so that there are enough buses continually running all through the night , so that they do not return and overload the depot . -you can make a long road to the depot so buses that do not fit in will just sit on the road leading to the depot . -for future games , use the custom ruleset feature and increase depot repair capacity . full credit goes to c40lfr for his post here .
the big difference between ultra 1 and ultra 2 is that ultra 2 ( breathless ) is a command grab . you can avoid it by jumping , or using a move that has invincibility , but you cannot block it . the armour allows you use it as an anti-air , assuming their attack does not cross-up . ultra 1 on the other hand can be blocked , but has two important properties : firstly it is an armour breaker , secondly it can be easily comboed into with his cr . hp " elbow launcher " . his launcher can in turn be comboed into by ( normal ) fadcing the first hit of his change of direction ( qcf+p ) . even if you mess up and cancel on block you can try a risky grab or roll . they both so a similar amount of damage , with soulless having an entirely negligible advantage but being scaled to a lower amount if you combo into it . a raw ultra 2 will deal more damage , than comboing into ultra 1 . this is important because comboing into ultra 1 will be the most likely scenario , compared to ultra 2 , which you will likely hit as a mixup ( note : it can be jumped out of on reaction ) or by using the armour . in usf4 , you have another option : red focus cancelling into ultra 2 . the first hit of change of direction ( qcf+p ) allows you to hit a red focus into ultra 2 . as for when to use which , it is really a personal choice . ultra 1 is consistent and you can land it fairly easily in almost every match . ultra 2 is tricker , but you may want to use it when you suspect a lot of jump-ins . an example of a matchup you may want to use ultra 2 in is abel vs yun . yun may miss-time/miss-space a divekick , leading to a free ultra 2 for you . finally , you of course have the option of w-ultra in usf4 . edit : a final note on the damage difference ( raw u2 vs combo u1 ) : if you only do cr . hp into u1 it still does more damage than a raw u2 . the damage of the ultra itself ( not the entire combo ) will be lower , however . in fact most combos into u1 will deal more damage than either a raw u2 or a combo ( ex red focus ) ending in u2 .
the elements from bl1 are unchanged , so shock is good versus blue shield bars , fire against red health bars , and corrosive against yellow armor bars . there is also explosive , which is sort of an all around element . slag has been added , and it increases the damage taken from other weapons instead of causing a damage-over-time effect . the commando class has lost many of the " turret support " effects it used to have , and most of the team healing has been moved to the siren . the ammo regen effects have moved to the gunzerker class . the classes fit similar archetypes as before , but have been tweaked significantly . weapons tended to be class-specific in bl1 , with special skills for each weapon restricted to a particular class . in bl2 , these limitations have been removed , and any class can theoretically excel with any weapon type . the level cap is currently 61 if you have the ultimate vault hunter upgrade pack ( $5 or included with the season pass ) . it is 50 otherwise . there are several " raid bosses " in the game , with some in the base game and each dlc adding more . the campaign bosses can also be re-fought , and each boss tends to have an increased chance of dropping a particular legendary item . the raid bosses in the dlc can also drop seraph crystals , which can be traded for certain rare items . there are several circles of slaughter that have 5 rounds each . one is in the fridge ( the bandit circle ) one is in the ore chasm ( the hyperion circle ) and one is paid/preorder dlc ( creature circle ) . these are similar to the underdome from bl1 . there is also the torgue dlc ( dlc pack #2 , included with the season pass ) which has several arena-style fights . rarity is important in weapon selection , but level is also important . it is hard to say which is the most important , or that there is a level&lt ; -> rarity conversion that works throughout all 61 levels . there is also a golden chest in the main hub town that can be opened with special golden keys you can get as rewards for certain actions ( usually finding codes for them via gearbox social media , etc ) . this box will generate random items of very high rarity which tend to be very powerful . eridium has been added as a currency , and it is used to purchase storage deck upgrades for your ammo capacity and storage capacity ( backpack , bank , etc ) , and you can use it to fight/re-fight the raid bosses .
a good medic knows that an early uber is better than a dropped uber but tries their best to hold onto their charge until it is necessary ( the use it or lose it rule ) . the most common reason why a medic pops their uber sooner than later is to primarily protect themselves and secondly because the situation calls for it . so in order to pop an uber it is best to hurt the medic . effective strategies to force an uber are : giving the medic a big burst of damage ( crits , sniper body shot , rockets/stickies/pipe spam , etc . ) the medic is on fire and probably will not make it to heal or be extinguished a spy is in his face and wants to protect himself an ubered enemy is coming towards them secondly , but much more unlikely , a medic will pop uber if he thinks that it might be useful . although not as common or effective , you can force an uber to pop early if the medic thinks : there is an engineer nest nearby there is a lot of enemies nearby there is another medic with an already popped uber
kormac the templar strengths good support character for higher difficulties , ranged classes , or while initially learning the game . can heal and taunt from the player when they are at low health . decent tank , as he can be equipped with one handed weapons and a shield in addition to rings and amulet . can provide good dps through the use of items that give " thorns " type damage on hit , as he will charge into the thick of combat and be hit by packs of enemies . level 20 " inspire " ability helps with resource regeneration for the player , leading to more opportunities for ability use weaknesses susceptible to being surrounded and killed fairly easily if not geared properly . his charge in and hack style gets him killed a lot by high difficulty elites . not a particularly good direct damage dealer suggested follower for : demon hunter , wizard , witch doctor , though he is a very useful follower for any class at more difficult stages . suggested gear stats : vitality , strength , " thorns " type damage on being struck in melee please note : follower stats are increased by a 2.5x multiplier on the 4 base stats , as denoted in this post . therefore , it is worthwhile to give followers items that increase these stats primarily . lyndon the scoundrel strengths good ranged support character for melee classes , has decent crowd control ability offensively focused , can deal more direct damage than the templar and enchantress good survival ability , high dexterity boosts his dodge chance and helps him avoid taking damage . level 15 " vanish " ability allows him to drop aggro and heal himself . can provide a boost to critical hits using either of his level 25 abilites " anatomy " or " hysteria " depending on preference witty and humorous , making his dialogue more interesting than other followers weaknesses not extremely durable if he gets cornered crowd control abilities are inferior to those of the classes he is ideally supporting like the enchantress , is prone to pulling groups before a player is ready suggested follower for : barbarian at early difficulties where templar healing is not necessary , monk at all difficulties . suggested gear stats : dexterity , vitality , +damage , +atkspd , crit% eirena the enchantress strengths good ranged support character for melee classes , has excellent crowd control ability good balance of support spells and damage dealing can buff the attack speed of the hero her charm ability even works on elites ( non-boss ) , which will completely incapacitate them for a short time or turn them against their allies . very helpful on high difficulties . high intelligence allows good mitigation of ranged attacks weaknesses not durable , but can generally get out of trouble with excellent crowd control ability damage is inferior to scoundrel , and can also be inferior to a properly geared templar like the scoundrel , will pull sometimes before player is ready suggested follower for : barbarian at early difficulties where templar healing is not necessary , monk at all difficulties , witch doctor at any difficulty . suggested gear stats : intelligence , vitality , +damage , +atkspd basically you should pick the follower to support your playstyle . i personally prefer to have the templar following me just about everywhere as i can count on him for an emergency heal and taunt when i get in trouble , he also provides increased resource regeneration so i can use my skills more often . however , there are obvious benefits at lower difficulties to use the scoundrel , where a tank type may not be as necessary and the direct dps increase helps get through mobs quicker . the enchantress can also be a good choice due to her cc ability in late difficulties where you do not want to get overwhelmed by numbers . this guide is current as of patch 2.0/reaper of souls
experience is gained by performing different activities in game , such as upgrading buildings , completing achievements , donating troops in clan , destroying town halls ( by raiding ) etc . the more experience you gain , the higher your level goes . to answer your question , the most effective and quicker way is by upgrading buildings . the buildings particularly the defense buildings are those which actually allow you to safeguard your town and collected resources . further the saved resources ( by raiding and collecting from mines both ) allows you to upgrade more buildings . achievements whereas do give you quite a lot of experience as well as gems but i will not consider it the quicker route as it takes a lot of time to literally complete some of the achievements . whereas destroying the town hall while raiding only gives you single-digit experience . moral : raid more > collect more resource > upgrade buildings . p . s- experience level does not define you as a good or a pro player . hope this helps . : )
yes . it is known as time-travelling . it has some real benefits if you want to access different events/seasons/upgrades during the game , throughout the year . there are two methods to do this . you can either adjust your 3ds clock , or adjust the in-game clock . select the method that best suits you and adjust the time/date accordingly : on your 3ds , go to : system settings > other settings > date and time > today 's date or current time . in the game , on main menu , go to : continue > select your " username " > " i need help first . . . " > " set the date/time " . beware , if you start time-travelling too much , you may miss villagers moving in and out , flowers/hybrids may become lost and you might find your town has more weeds than normal . also , if you choose the 1st option , beware that adjusting your 3ds clock may have affects on your other games and applications .
start splitting your workers to your other bases , if you have any , and they are not already saturated . you mentioned you waited for energy to scan , it would probably be quicker/easier to get one or two of your mineral workers to throw down a couple of missile turrets ( out of reach of the mines ) as soon as you figure out what is going on , as opposed to waiting for your scan to refill . however preempting this sort of attack is probably the best strategy . a drop is a fairly common tactic , but can be easily thwarted or even deterred entirely by a fairly thin defensive line . drop one missile turret ( terran ) , photon cannon ( protoss ) or spore crawler ( zerg ) and they would have provided enough detection for your other units to quickly clean this up , and would act as a deterrent for the initial drop as well .
i was looking for this answer myself and could not find it , so i just did a quick test : i had a weapon loader at . 87 , . 92 , and . 97 weapon speed . i tested with a stopwatch and averaged around 9 and 41 seconds without any weapon loader upgrade . then i tried the . 87 only and averaged around 8 and 23 seconds . then i tested all of them together and averaged at 7 and 34 seconds . when i did some math with those numbers , it appears that the game takes the non-upgraded time and then applies your best upgrade and gives you a new time . after that , it uses that new time with your second best upgrade and then uses that third time for your third best upgrade . which is still nice but not as good as if all three just got added together which would give you a missile refresh time of 7 and 15 seconds as opposed to the 7 and 34 which it ends up being .
for raw damage , the empress is the best , unless you have blood of the martyr , in which case the devil is the best . the specific stats are as follows : the empress gives you the whore of babylon effect for 1 room . damage is increased by 2.16 , and speed by 0.36 . the devil gives you the book of belial effect . damage is increased by 2 . additionally , if you have the blood of the martyr item , your damage is further increased by 1.5x . it also increases the chance of a devil room spawning by 25% . strength gives you the effect of a large odd mushroom effect for 1 room . hp is increased by 1 , damage is increased by 0.3 , range by 2.75 , and speed is decreased by 0.1 .
short answer : yes , it is fine to install it . if the game requires that version of the library , it will not run ( properly ) without it . long answer : frameworks like directx , opengl etc are ( basically ) just collections of common functions i.e. things which every program needs to do , but do not need to be reinvented/rewritten every time you write a new program . directx for example , is a collection of application programming interfaces ( apis ) for handling tasks related to multimedia , especially game programming and video . of course , being programs and libraries themselves , they get updated regularly with bug fixes , new features , improvements to the performance of older functions , and sometimes ( especially major updates ) a restructuring and rebuilding of the entire package itself . what this means is that sometimes when older programs attempt to access features in the newer frameworks , those features are not there . they have either been moved , renamed , or changed drastically so that the result is not what the program was expecting . for example , say a game relied on a function : DrawObjectToScreen(Object o, Point p);  which takes an object , and a point , representing the pixel coordinates ( x , y ) for the object . but an update to the framework comes out , the above method is removed and replaced by : Draw(Object o, Point p);  our game does not know about Draw() . it looks for DrawObjectToScreen() , does not find it , and throws an error . so in order for a development company to upgrade a program to a newer framework , they would need to : learn how things changed in the new version find all the missing/broken references to the old framework , and upgrade and replace them . sometimes they might have to restructure entire sections of code to workaround the newer apis . upgrade and individually test each place where the new framework has new functionality , to ensure that nothing has changed or broken as a result of the upgrade . find and fix/workaround any bugs related to the new version of the framework build up a version of the program for release , including documentation ( release notes ) , strategies for dissemination of the new version etc release the new version , and deal with any bugs that arise ( not working properly on different os builds etc ) . and all of this would provide little benefit to the end users : the program worked fine on the old version , and nothing new was added* you have forced them to update , or at least deal with mismatches between someone having one version and someone having another you may have introduced more bugs than you fixed . *except performance or the ability to run on newer/different oss and platforms , which would be the major justification for doing this . so yes , if a program requires a certain version of a framework , it would be best to install that version . luckly these days this is usually handled for you when you run the installer .
the easiest , yet by far most cheap and tedious , way to unlock this is to go to the weather the storm encounter in shandalar . mulligan down to one and then simply do not play anything , not even land . the encounter has no creatures , and can only damage you through the cards you play . as a result , it will simply play a second aether storm as soon as it can afford to , and then mill itself down to 0 playing land for the rest of the game .
i had this exact problem , it ended up being a loose hdmi connection . when the screen is showing all the little red parts , try readjusting the hdmi cord . if it is indeed an hdmi connector issue , you should see the red turn back to normal instantly . check both hdmi connector ends . if you are not using hdmi , check the ends of whatever connector you are using . the way you can verify that this is the problem is by taking a screenshot , saving it to a file , then viewing it on another machine . if it looks fine on the other machine , then it is a connector or monitor issue .

this video shows the solution of the 12th glyph . the part you are asking for starts at 2:19 . the comment says that " there is the symbol in the newspaper article and the number on the left car . "
according to the wiki at ign , you can run the secret area as many times as you like . this has been confirmed several times since , including this video . once you have a staff of herding for a difficulty , you can enter the secret area as many times as you want . you can use the staff from a higher difficulty to open the secret level in a lower difficulty so you can feel free to create the hellish or infernal staff of herding when you are able .
problem went away on its own a few turns later .
it should be possible . the main factor to consider would be the graphics performance , which , given that the air has a geforce 320m should be fine . the tech specs for battlefield 2142 , according to apple 's downloads page are : mac os x 10.4.9 or later intel core duo processor or higher 512mb of ram ( 1gb recommended ) ati x1600 , nvidia geforce 7300 gt , or higher video card ( intel gma950 chipset not supported ) the tech specs for the macbook air : minimum 2gb ram , minimum 1.4ghz core 2 duo processor , nvidia geforce 320m graphics processor with 256mb of ddr3 sdram shared with main memory ( meaning it'll deduct the vram is needs from your system ram , which is 2gb minimum ) should be ok !
dragon souls can be saved , so do not worry that the effort in killing the dragon is lost . please note that you need to discover additional shouts if you have learned/activated all your current words , this way you can use your saved dragon souls on the new words of the new shouts . shouts are discovered on the walls of old ruins , and gained by slaying and absorbing the souls of dragons . as more are slain the users ability to learn and use new shouts increases . &mdash ; wikia - elder scrolls v : skyrim - dragon shouts in order to learn new shouts , you need to find all these word walls ; you can get a quest to the next : although finding word walls can be very challenging try and use shouts in major cities . whenever you do this you should receive a note from a courier which tells you " a note for your hands only " this note starts a quest to find a source of power and the current location of the next word wall . &mdash ; wikia - elder scrolls v : skyrim - word wall ( contains more details on all the locations ) to actually learn a new shout , once you have discovered the word wall and have a dragon soul to use , you need to manually activate it in the shouts menu . select the shout and press the activate button . it should be shown on your screen , but i believe the buttons are : r on pc x on xbox □ on ps3
according to the official tf2 wiki : the system resets each player 's playtime cap every thursday at approximately 00:00 greenwich mean time ( gmt ) . this is approximate - there may not be a single , precise time for everyone . not everything published in the official tf2 wiki is in itself official , though .
both ; ) you need ram to hold the data - polygons , textures etc . more ram will allow you to show more detailed textures and run at higher resolutions . you need a good gpu to do all the calculations needed for a modern game - lighting , physics etc . the better the gpu the more of these calculations you can do so you will get better effects and it will have an impact on the resolution too . check the specs of those cards and then you need to decide what is important - resolution , effects etc . and go for the card that is better at those things .
kill flesh stick again and again in the tina special guest quest . best if your coop partner stays by her and keeps beginning the mission while you are where he spawns waiting for him with a shotgun or else . at lvl 14 its 1800exp every time . i leveled to 20 in 5 minutes . note : if you restart the quest too quickly fleshstick will stop spawning and you will have to reload the area . to avoid this , wait until tiny tina finishes her line ending with " my abode " . if you mess up , first she will not speak her next line . if this happens , wait a minute or two ( to let tina finish the sentence , even though you can not hear it ) and start the mission once more , tina should talk again .
because they carry significantly higher voltage than copper cables , you actually need to put multiple layers of insulation on gold cables . ( you can do this by crafting the insulated cables with more rubber like you to do get them in the first place ) . having said that , i believe you may still take a small amount of damage even from 2x insulated gold cables . consider concealing your wiring entirely .
well , according to this discussion : over a 100second test window , i recorded a mean of 31,630 bytes/sec and a max of 159,371 bytes/sec . that works out to an average of 0.1gb/hr/user as a rough ballpark measure that seems fairly believable ( this was posted just under a year ago however , so spm network performance could have changed since then ) . of course it depends a lot on what the users are doing , for example if a player moves around a lot then i imagine that the network use may be greater as the server needs to send more environment data to the client , similarly whenever users connect and disconnect network use will probably spike . my advice would be to have a go yourself using 100 mb / hr / user as an initial guess . you should also take into account the distinction between upload and download bandwidth , as many isps have a much smaller limit on upload bandwidth .
yes , the attacks do end after finishing the main quest . tangentially , the attacks will begin as soon as you install dawnguard , not after beginning dawnguard-related quests . some consider this a misfeature enough that there is a mod to disable attacks until you begin the dawnguard quests .
breach bombs damage systems and crew , and cause cracks , but do not hurt hulls . alternate bombing the medical bay and the o 2 generator . put priority on whichever one the crew is trying to repair . eventually they will have so little health they will not try to repair things , and you can just wait . if the ship does not have a medical bay it is even easier - just bomb the o 2 generator until they stop trying to repair it . if you are taking this tack , it helps to upgrade your own shields ( and maybe have a defense drone ) so you can sit and wait them out without having to waste missiles bombing their weapons as well . ion weapons can help , but it is hard to get enough of them to punch through 3-4 shields reliably , while you are still getting shot at . if you have them , great , but do not prioritize them . you are correct about sensors . do not even bother trying to kill crew without damaging the ship until you have the first sensor upgrade or a slug crew member .
saturn 's just a random boss that always spawns there . he is a bit of a puzzle as i do not recall any other " boss out of freaking nowhere " moments in borderlands , but he is almost a boss for the info stockade mission . he is optional though , you can just run past him if he does not kill you . there is no story ( unless i missed something in 2 full playthroughs ) related to him . he does somewhat resemble metal gear rex though from metal gear solid ( it is not the first mgs reference they have made either ) but i have no idea what the name would refer to . so yeah , he is just kinda there . he is " special " in that he is a boss but that is about it . no missions , but he respawns like other bosses .
carve a ramp , they go upwards . you can then build a downward staircase and replace the ramp with an upward staircase . the ramp may become unusable after constructing the upper staircase , so send that fish dissector if the area is dangerous or you are expecting delays .
big mods like the floris pack are independent from the native game in mount and blade . the mod is installed in it is own folder , and you must choose it before launching the game . therefore , reverting back to native is just a matter of sectioning native over the mod . saves are also mod specific , so your save with the mod will mot be mixed with native saves , your previous save remains unaffected . the floris pack in itself aims at adding new functionality to the native game while still conserving the feeling of the original . it is not compatible with the multiplayer , but you can just go back to native for it .
the dogs spawn for ~60 seconds continuously . there tends to only be 4-5 dogs active at once , but when one dies another replaces it by jumping into the map somewhere else . however , the dog mechanic is quite a bit different in black-ops then it was in world at war . because dogs are harder to get ( 11 kill streak instead of 7 ) they now kill in 1 bite . but instead of immediately ' knowing ' the location of enemies dogs are now attracted to gunfire , making them much easier to avoid
the 2012 rpg has a story that is largely independent of the a song of ice and fire novel series and game of thrones television show . it shares a fictional universe , and some locations , but the characters and plot are different and the timeline of the game finishes around halfway through the first book .
both the pact of secrecy and pact of cooperation have been removed from newer versions of the game . since version 1.0.1.135 ( 15th december 2010 ) they have been approximately replaced with the declaration of friendship and denounce , which have a similar meaning behind them , but are both now public and have more visible diplomatic repercussions . since version 1.0.1.217 ( 1st march 2011 ) both of these also expire after 50 turns . being a friend with another nation has the following effects : your relationship with the nation is improved ( i think so , anyway ) . the friend nation may occasionally request aid ( eg , gold , luxury resource , etc ) - if you refuse , there is a long term negative effect on your relationship . if you befriend a nation , this will often have a positive effect on your relationships with other nations who are friends with the nation you befriend . if you befriend a nation , this will often have a negative effect on your relationships with other nations who dislike the nation you befriend . groups of nations that are all friends with one another can effectively form a sort of unofficial alliance , and it can be powerful to be within a group of this nature . similarly , be wary of attacking/upsetting a nation in a group , because you might find they drag all their allies in to the fight against you .
this should be a complete list now : http://www.gamebanshee.com/legendofgrimrock/secrets/secrets_level1.php it has levels 1-10 and lvl 13 . the number of secrets seem to vary , but here are the numbers : level 1: 3 level 2: 6 level 3: 8 level 4: 8 level 5: 7 level 6: 12 level 7: 9 level 8: 6 level 9: 4 level 10: 6 level 13: 2 this gives 71 . that should be all the secrets found , if i have written the numbers correct . gamebanshee now states it has 70 of 71 secrets , but i have gotten it as 71 . the secrets are counted such that if there is a secret on level 4 that can only be reached by dropping in a pit from level 3 , it is counted as a level 3 secret , not a level 4 secret .
original ps2 and ps1 games running on the ps3 ( this applies both to the disc versions and the downloadable versions from the psn store ) save and load to virtual memory cards on the system . if you use the adapter on your original memory cards , they will transfer into these virtual cards and be usable by the original versions . remastered ( i.e. . hd ) versions of ps2 games , however , use the ps3 save data format , and do not access the memory cards at all . so unfortunately , no , this will not work .
if the pc version is like the 360 version , you hold the button you used to activate eagle vision for around 2-3 seconds .
all the big 30-point symptoms near the center line are excellent at killing people off in job lots , although tricks like pneumonia or hypersensitivity can potentially be more effective in their specialized areas ( as the descriptions state , pneumonia is especially dangerous in cold areas while hypersensitivity is particularly dangerous in urban environments where exposure to various allergens is much more common ) . i am personally a fan of coma because it also makes the disease harder to cure and necrosis because it means that corpses still remain infective ( which can be a big plus if you have not infected everyone yet ) .
backstabs deal 600% of the target 's current health , as listed on the spy-cicle 's wiki page . i believe this damage is the same as all knives ' backstabs . so killing an almost-dead scout will yield damage much lower than an overhealed heavy , but the intent is basically that no matter how much health your target is and no matter what ridiculous , unfeasible buffs they have , a backstab will instant kill them from damage alone ( though a couple things like the razorback can still save you ) . also note that , while spy backstabs are automatic crits , the damage they deal is not " critical damage " . effects that block critical hits will not reduce backstab damage at all . as listed on the item 's page the spy-cicle can do 34-46 damage with a frontal hit , but melee damage does not affect how much a backstab does .
it is now built into 1.4.5 ( and perhaps earlier 1.4 . x ) . this is a command built into the server , and also single-player , if you have cheats enabled . /gamerule mobgriefing false exactly as you want : creepers damage players but not blocks . as a bonus , i just installed the " ice cream sandwich creeper mod " -- in snow biome , creeper explosions leave . . . well , just as the name implies . there is also full crafting support .
i found kaos 's castle really good for gathering coin , especially if you have 3 or 4 wealth wheels in the luck o tron
as fbueckert notes , you only start " wasting " food once the entire system is fully populated . beyond that , extra food is not very useful . there is one improvement , late in the east technology tree , that converts 100% of surplus food into industry , but you are much more likely to fully population cap systems before you make it to that point . two things that bear consideration , however , are colonists and +pop system improvements . making a colony ship will actually remove one unit of population from your system ( just as scrapping a colony ship will automatically add one population to the nearest star system , if possible ) . in the short term , you can use the population-capped system to produce colony ships , and though i do not know the details , it seems that some food and production are stored , such that if a population capped system produces a colony ship , the planet will immediately regain its lost population from the " wasted " turns . ( though , again , i do not know the exact mechanics ) the other thing you might want to consider is are the +population improvements , the earliest of which is endothermic structures ( +1 to small , +2 to tiny ) . as soon as you build one of those structures , the population cap increase , and you will need food production until you max out again . neither of these are permanent solutions , however . the only consistent use for wasted food is from the end-tier , " dust virtualization " tech .
without scripts , no . however there are several scripts that can help you out , depending on what you are looking for . the tf2 wiki has a page of sniper scripts , this one may be useful ( it is a quickscope script however , not a ' hold to zoom' ) : bind mouse3 "+qz;" alias +qz "+attack2; wait 33; -attack2; +attack; wait 3; -attack;"  and this steam forum had this to offer : your cfg folder can be found here : %programfiles%/steam/steamapps/%common%/team fortress 2/tf/cfg . this guide will tell you all about your scripting and config files .
it all started with this tweet from rockstar official support : for optimal performance , we recommend not installing that disc . we will have more info on our support site at launch . in their official support page they wrote : i know grand theft auto v has an 8 gb mandatory install . if i want to install the play disc too , through xbox home ( dashboard ) , is that possible ? for optimal performance , we recommend only installing the install disc , and not also installing the play disc to the xbox 360 hard drive or usb drive via xbox home ( dashboard ) . you will be prompted to install the install disc the first time you boot the game .
glass bows can be looted from enemies , and they have the highest chances of occurring between levels 27 and 32 . above that , you are more likely to see things that are ebony , and much more rarely , daedric . you can also purchase them randomly from vendors , with i believe the best odds of finding one occurring around the same levels . you can also just make your own - if your smithing skill is 70 or more , and you have the glass smithing perk , you can take 2 refined malachite and 1 refined moonstone to a blacksmith workshop and make one from scratch . this perk also allows you to improve your glass weapons and armor , which considerably improves the damage output of the glass bow . as far as guaranteed loot , i am not aware of any besides the glass bow of the stag prince which is part of the dragonborn expansion .
it seems that the assassination missions lester gives to franklin , beginning after the first heist , are the most obvious scripted occurances of stock market fluctuation . most of these affect lcn , but some are companies on bawsaq . before each mission , invest in the target 's competitor , ideally with multiple characters . the missions are as follows : hotel assassination -- invest in bettapharmaceuticals . redwood cigarette assassination -- invest in debonair cigarettes . vice assassination -- invest in fruit . bus assassination -- invest in vapid after the mission . the stock will fall , but then rise again . construction assassination -- invest in gold coast . also , there is a random encounter in which you take a gentleman in a suit to the airport . if you get him there on time , he will tell you to invest in tickled on the bawsaq market . doing so is a good idea , as this stock will climb rapidly for some time . additionally , as noted by other answers , performing actions against a company may increase the value of it is competitors . examples given include destroying flyus planes in order to improve the stock of airemu and vice versa . the rivals of a company are summarised well in this answer to another question . however , i have not seen this actually work and fear it may just be a rumour at the games release that has been repeated so many times that everyone accepts it for truth .
gems in torchlight ii are split into two categories , there are normal gems ( for example venom ember , spark ember , ice ember , etc ) and rare gems ( for example blood ember ) . the difference is that normal gems always have the same attributes for each level of gem , while rare gems have randomly assigned attributes from a selection . here is a list of all gems in torchlight ii and their possible attributes , as you can see blood ember speck is capable of having either of the following attributes :
it appears to inflict the skatha 's roots effect on the monster it hits , and leaves a 1 space poison cloud which causes vile poison .
according to sources i could find online , crysis 2 uses securom for disc checking , and uses tages solidshield to enforce a 5 activation limit per serial number . it does not appear to use an always-on drm scheme like steam and origin do . the steam edition removes the securom , ( as there is no disc ) but keeps the tages drm . it seems like it is possible to " reclaim " some of the activations ( ie , if you format and reinstall ) if you are willing to get into contact with the publisher 's customer support .

before anything , the compendium is the way valve gives the community to participate in the grow of dota 2 . the compendium is a one time purchase and $2.5 of each compendium purchased is added to the prize pool of the international ( the biggest yearly dota 2 tournament ) , furthermore 25% of the money raised by points you can purchase to level your compendium up is also added to the prize pool . the dota 2 compendium is a virtual booklet which bring features to its owner such as : exclusive cosmetic items ( for the hero but also : hud , taunt , base personalization etc . ) lots of reward as more stretch goals are broken ( currently the last 10m$ stretch goal was broken a few days ago ) the ability to bet on the outcome of the international to compare your result with your friends collect pro players cards ( just like pokemon cards ! ) play challenges to increase your compendium level ( increasing your compendium level gives you even more rewards ) xp booster ( to drop cosmetic items more frequently when playing dota ) and much more . . . this is by no mean mandatory and will not improve your ability to play . you will not play with a disadvantage by not having one but this is a nice feature to participate in the community .
there are five levels of research for each ' creature ' in the game . i am not sure if there is a way to know what level you are currently at . once you have completed all of the levels for a specific creature type , your camera will not accept photos of those creatures anymore . a bit more about researching , from the bioshock wiki : the research camera does no damage itself , but it is a deadly addition to the arsenal . it is equipped the same way as a weapon , and uses film to take pictures that unlock biological weaknesses and hidden secrets through research of every splicer , security device , and big daddy . in each tree , there are five levels of research that require increasingly more photos to complete . on the first , third , and fifth levels of completed research , a permanent damage boost is applied against the researched enemy type . the second and fourth levels of completed research yield various gene tonics and other bonuses that are extremely useful . little sisters are the exception , as a permanent increase to health and eve is given for each completed level of research . the damage research tonic increases effectiveness of damage bonuses from research . the research camera cannot be upgraded .
the best loot guide around that i know is backed up with code snippets . the executive summary : each building is triggered individually , and has its own loot-spawn timer . loot spawns as soon as a player is closer than 120m but farther than 30m from the building . the building 's loot spawn timer also starts then . every 10 minutes new loot will spawn if and only if there is a player in the 120–30m ring . a player in that ring will cause loot to spawn on the timer even if there is another player inside the 30m ring . if you are not inside that ring when the timer checks for a player , there will be no new loot . each spawn location in a building has a 50% chance to populate whenever spawning is triggered , so emptying loot spots helps . backpacks and ammo cases do not count when the code checks if there is already loot in a spot . bonus : zombies spawn when a player enters a 200m circle . for a pretty picture of the trigger ranges and the code snippets to back these up , read the full guide .
you will not be able to re-download them , or play any games that you had previously downloaded and installed via playstation plus . if you try to download any of the games from your download history , it will not work . however , if you later decide to renew your subscription , these games will become available for use again . they are even re-downloadable , as long as you added the games to your cart and successfully checked out before their free offer period passed . q : how long do i get to keep the games in the instant game collection ? a : games in the instant game collection are free to download with a plus membership . as long as you are a playstation plus member , you will always have access to any game you have downloaded in the collection , even if you have deleted a game from your hard drive previously . q : if a game rotates out of the collection , can i still download it free with my plus membership ? a : if you did not download the game when it was in the collection , you will not be able to secure your free download . however , if you downloaded when it was in the collection , but it is no longer on your hard drive , you can visit the playstation store and re-download it anytime , as long as you are a member . q : how many times can i download / re-download a game in the instant game collection ? a : you can download a game as many times as you like , even if it is been deleted from your ps3 hdd , as long as you are a plus member . q : what happens to the games i downloaded from the instant game collection if i decide to not renew my membership ? a : you will not be able to access free games downloaded with plus if you choose not to renew your membership . however , if you decide to re-activate your membership , you will once again be able to play all games downloaded from the instant game collection . more information can be found at psn 's support page here .
on the android version , you can not get this achievement , because the required button does not exist . it was added in a fairly recent version , presumably by mistake - it was removed again in today 's update , which seems to confirm that it should never have shown up on android .

found a couple other people and have the same problem myself . seems to go away if apartment life is removed . no other fix found yet .
the aliens in extraction missions spawn neither indefinitely nor randomly . spawning of each one is triggered when the vip reaches a map area . after you extracted the vip , you still need to take out the remaining aliens . so you have to kill them all anyway .
yes , it is possible . there is theoretically no limit , but the likelyhood of dungeons spawning with their sides touching is a rapidly plummeting percentage chance as the number of dungeons you are considering increases . to write this answer about dungeon spawning density i delved into the code . the more thorough explanation there will be helpful , but the short version is : on generation , a chunk will try 8 times to spawn a dungeon in 1&lt ; =y&lt ; =128 . the location to try is determined randomly , and only then does the game check if it is a legal spot to spawn it , so many of those 8 tries will fail . dungeons only spawn under very precise conditions that depend on there being just the right amount of air blocks where their walls would be . the game will not try its best to fit a dungeon in – it will blindly randomly determine the dungeon 's size and location , and if it does not fit perfectly , it will simply not be placed . also note that multi-spawner dungeons are not something that the code actually tries to create – they are simply accidents of placement of single dungeons adjacent to each other . in particular , notice that the 8-per-chunk limit is only a limit per chunk , so multi-spawner dungeons can easily be made up of single dungeons from different neighbouring chunks . that is why the theoretical limit is infinite . the per-chunk limit is only useful to know because it illustrates how often ( or not ) the spawning algorithm creates dungeons at all . so , to spawn four dungeons together would require that 4 spawning checks ( in the same or adjacent chunks ) happened to randomly place dungeons within 4 blocks vertically of each other in a chain , and that the x/z spots randomly chosen just happened to be exactly far enough apart to make their walls line up in exactly the right way to satisfy the air-block tests that the dungeon spawner does . the likelyhood of this is very low ! but it could happen . it becomes slightly more likely if there are narrow tunnels that could join them , but " slightly more likely " in this case is still a very , very small chance . but wait ! it is worse than that . we do not care about how often they spawn , but how often we discover them . add in the likelihood that , even if a chunk did spawn a four-dungeon dungeon , you had probably never dig into that part of the world to discover it ; and the chance of finding a four-dungeon dungeon then becomes almost vanishingly small .
oak 's right , there is a setting to turn them off for an entire match . in case you want to do that : set up game > advanced setup > quick combat as pretty as the animations are , they slow the game too much for me so i always play with them off . though now that i know oak 's f10 trick ( +1 , nice tip ) maybe i will consider enabling the prettiness for some matches . :- )
the shield blocks 400 damage regardless of magic resistance . the 30% magic resistance is calculated everytime , as it is passive . so , for the fingers of death example : if you dont have the shield activated , it will deal -30% damage . if you do , it will still dealing -30% damage , and the rest of the damage will be used to lower your " shield " ammount of magic block . lion 's ultimate info can be found here Level 1 : 500 Damage - 600 With Aghanim's Level 2 : 650 Damage - 800 With Aghanim's Level 3 : 850 Damage - 1025 With Aghanim's  so , 30% magic res . would lower the damages to : so , ignoring any extra magic defense that the heroe may have , you would be able to completely ignore the ultimate 's damage only if he is at level 1 , and without aghanims . otherwise , you would take some extra damage . hope it helps . source : self tested @ dota 2 with friends .

hold the activate key ( e , ⓧ , or ⓐ by default for pc , ps3 , and xbox , respectively ) . the z key defaults to your dragon shout/racial power on pc . be careful with that .
in your " recent " replays folder in game , there is a button to the left called " keep " . pressing this button will move the replay into the " multiplayer " tab if it was a ladder or custom game . then , from here , navigate to your sc2 account directory , which on windows is usually located under : c:\users\username\documents\starcraft ii\accounts\some numbers here\some more numbers here\replays\multiplayer also , you can download replays from the internet and then copy them directly to that folder , and they should show up instantly under the " multiplayer " replay tab in the game ! in addition , any of the replays that you have not selected to " keep " should show up under the " unsaved " folder within your account under " replays " , here : c:\users\username\documents\starcraft ii\accounts\some numbers here\some more numbers here\replays\unsaved that folder will only keep about 25 of the most recent replays before it starts replacing the old ones , so please refer to this question for more options on how to save more , or manage your replay saves .

this questions is similar to a question i asked about how to use walls , but since i think you have a more general focus- i will give you a more general answer : ) . constructing a good defense is complicated . arguably its the most challenging aspect of the game . it is hard to define a " best " defense , since attackers will use different counter-strategies , the defensive options available to you vary by level , and new strategies are evolving all the time . that said , here are some tips i find helpful . step 1 - decide to protect trophies or resources this is an easy decision if you do not have much of one or the other , but you will eventually have to choose . protecting your resources will be important when you are saving up for the late game upgrades - some of which will require days or even weeks of stockpiling to afford . protecting your trophies means protecting your town hall and minimizing collateral damage - so as to minimize or eliminate " cheap " one star victories for your opponents . step 2a - protecting resources the best protection for resources , is to spend them - but of course sometimes that is not an option . given that , it is best to put your storage containers deep inside your base , ideally behind concentric walls . put your most powerful defensive buildings close your your storage containers , and consider putting traps near them as well . also , and this may seem unintuitive - make your town hall vulnerable . it is up to you whether you want to leave it totally undefended , or with minimum defenses - but make sure its the target that attackers focus on . when it is destroyed you get an 8 hour shield for free . if it is well protected it is actually possible to get attacked over and over - resulting in massive resource losses , without ever getting a shield . step 2b - protecting trophies if you are going this route , the most important thing is to keep your town hall well protected - using the same strategy mentioned in step 2a for your storage containers . opponents can also get a 1 star victory by destroying 50% of your buildings , so keep your buildings close together , and fit whatever you can behind walls . since you are less focused on resources , it is also good to spend as much as you can on walls and simple upgrades , which will make you less of an attractive target . step 3 - general tips get a clan castle , and join a clan that is active enough to keep it filled . units from the clan castle are free to you , and are a nice boost to defenses . use " less valuable " buildings like builder huts and barracks to distract attackers . note that these buildings create a " keep out " which can be used to control where the enemy can drop troops - forcing a long walk under fire , as opposed to getting dropped right where they want . decorations can also be used in this way - but note that they do not create a keepout ( other than the space they occupy ) . the edge of the world is no protection . do not use it like a wall . it is in fact better to build a little away from it - see previous point . mortars have a close in " blind spot " . use walls and building to " fill " this blind spot so enemy units can not stand in it . defensive buildings ( cannons , mortars , archer towers , etc ) should all overlap , to protect each other . any time you upgrade defensive buildings , remember they are out of commission . try to cover the " hole " they make with other defensive buildings , and avoid upgrading too many at the same time .
mmo-champion has posted this excellent map of the zone flow from 1-85 post-shattering : a more detailed breakdown can be found at wowpedia in short , eastern kingdoms goes tirsifal → silverpine → hillsbrad → arathi → hinterlands → western&nbsp ; plaguelands → eastern&nbsp ; plaguelands → badlands → searing&nbsp ; gorge → burning steppes → blasted&nbsp ; lands . kalimdor goes mulgore/durotar → northern&nbsp ; barrens/azshara → ashenvale → stonetalon&nbsp ; mountains → desolace → feralas → thousand&nbsp ; needles → tanaris → un'goro → silithus . alternately , you can jump off the path after hillsbrad/ashenvale , head to northern stranglethorn , and continue from there into southern stranglethorn , south barrens , dustwallow marsh , before rejoining the kalimdor path at thousand needles . after completing thousand needles or western plaguelands , you again have the opportunity to jump paths , and can follow quests through felwood and winterspring instead , though you may need to hop back to silithius and/or blasted lands to get the last few levels you need before outland if you go that route .
as of patch 2.0 , all items level 1-60 now salvage into common debris ( for white and grey items ) , exquisite essences ( for blue items ) , iridescent tears ( for yellow items ) , or fiery brimstones ( for legendary items ) . any of the old crafting items you had were converted into their equivalent new item . items from level 61-70 turn into reusable parts , arcane dust , veiled crystals , and forgotten souls for white , blue , yellow , and legendary items , respectively .
you recieve an abandon if : you disconnect from the game and fail to reconnect within 5 minutes ( given that the game keeps on playing , if the game is paused , the 5 min are not ticking ) you disconnect from the game and explicitly click the " leave game " button ( in the matchmaking menu ) you spend more than 5 min in the game without earning any experience ( the game then conciders you afk and give you an abandon ) you have not interacted with the game in the last 2 minutes you used to recieve a " secondary abandonment " if one of the member in your party abandoned the game ( following one of the condition listed above ) . those were displayed between bracket in your dota profile : Abandon : number of abandon (number of secondary abandonment)  but since one of the last patch they are no longer counted and you just have a global % of game abandonned in your profile .
the golden bee appears randomly ( 1/50 chance ) . your best bet is to just keep slamming into trees and cutting grass and bushes until it appears . the golden bee is differentiated by a golden glow surrounding it , as well as being stronger and tougher than a regular bee . if you do not want to catch one , you can purchase one from several vendors in lorule . skull woods : the mysterious man in the cave will sell you one for 888 rupees . various regular vendors in lorule sell one for 9999 rupees . i do not recommend buying one , as the cost dwarfs the reward : the bee guy will pay 300 rupees for each golden bee , as well as give you the Bee Badge for the first golden bee you turn in . the badge makes all bees friendly to you and they will attack enemies ( just as if you let the bee out of your bottle ! ) .
the items you have collected will disappear from your inventory , and ores that have been generated will be filled with air blocks .
these are guest passes : i had 3 of them in the retail boxed version of the game . each one has a one-time-use code , which allows another person to download the game , and play it with certain restrictions . on the back , it reads : the guest account allows you to play diablo 3 for free up to the skeleton king boss in act 1 . note that certain game features are restricted on guest accounts - to remove these restrictions , please upgrade to the full version of the game . blizzard 's faq on this system says that the guest pass grants you the " starter edition " of the game , and says the following about restrictions : act i up to the skeleton king is available level 13 cap matchmaking available only with other starter edition players no real money auction house access global play is not available . players attempting to connect to diablo iii starter edition in a region other than their battle .netaccount 's home region will receive error 12 . see the global play support article for more information . no guest passes are included with the downloadable version that you can purchase directly from blizzard . some related guest pass questions : do guest pass characters carry through an upgrade to the full game ? does a diablo 3 guest pass let you play with regular players ?
spawn a map item . then go into the server 's world folder-> data , and delete the new maps ' files . ( like if you want to clone map_3 as map_0 , delete map_3 ) then , copy and paste map_0 ( or whatever map you are cloning , and rename it to the new map ( example , map_3 ) notch may add a cloning feature in the future , though !
no you do not have to complete the mission , however you do have to be connected online .
this glitch may sometimes be fixed by saving and exiting to the main menu , then re-entering the game . the symbol may also just disappear with time , so it effectively seems to mean " you tried to capture this system somewhat recently " , rather than " you are trying to capture this system right now " . the above quote is from the spore wiki .
i have been looking around and there are a few reasons it might not have trigged in my case i usually read faster than npcs speak , so often skip dialog . one of the pre-requisits for triggering the quest is talking to the sea captain in windhelm , and sometimes skipping his dialog will cause the quest not to trigger according to this site , the quest will occasionally not trigger if more than 245 in-game days have passed i have had people tell me that if you finish the rescue at fort neugard quest for the stormcloaks , you cannot trigger the blood on ice quest . all my save files are from after that quest was completed , so i can not really go back and test if that is the case . so it looks like i am just sol until bethesda decides to patch the game so people can buy the windhelm house .
i have checked out a few sources , and the average playtime is around 40 hours , although this depends largely on how many side quests you do . people who mostly focused on the main quest had times closer to 35 , where as those that spent more time on side quests were closer to 45 or higher . it should be noted that after you beat the game , you unlock hero mode . this is essentially a second quest with increased difficulty .
it is in the manual on page 11 but just in case you did not get a manual with your used game : launch the game wait for the screen with red nintendo letters on a black screen . then press and hold the l , r , a , b , x , and y buttons all at the same time . this will give you the option to erase the saved data .
the " hard cap " is level 81 , while the " softcap " is level 50 . this means from level 50 onward it gets progressively harder to level until level 81 ( when all skills reach 100 ) you can not level at all . source
as always microsoft in coalition with bethesda make the best puzzles . my windows 8.1 pro n by default does not have windows media player . after install of windows media player the game is working perfectly . install instructions for fallout 3 on windows 8.1 install lates k-lite codecs install fallout 3 and lates updates install windows live client install windows media player right click this file and open notepad : documents\my games\fallout3\fallout . ini find ( control+f ) busethreadedai=0 change to busethreadedai=1 immediately after this line , add this new line : inumhwthreads=2 links : windows live client , windows media player
tip 1: well , my first tip would be , buy a mouse . spending even just 10 dollars on a mouse will exponentially help with pvp . also if your computer has the capability to run fast , then let it . this helps reduce lag while in battles . tip 2: second off , when playing pvp , hiding and running is not bad . it can increase your chances of winning . surprise attacks take advantage of the hiding technique . also , players running through you can be to your advantage in some situations . if you are running away from someone , you can turn around and run right through them . this method works , but it does not always work on everyone . especially those lots of pvp experience . tip 3: third , there is a way to get a critical strike . to get a critical strike , hit another player while falling . also if you are using a bow , if you hold it back for longer periods of time , then it will do more damage when it hits another player . hope this all helps !
i am not sure how to do this on the console , but i know that you can remove friends from xbox . com . log in using the windows live id associated with your gamertag , and go to the friends center . there is a " remove " button by each person on your friends list that you can use to remove them .
from what i have gathered after doing a bit of research , the xbox one supports dlna but only as a receiver . it will not actively search and find source files , but will happily play anything that is pushed to it via the dlna protocol . however , as i do not have an xbox one i can not physically verify this but a quick google search for xbox one dlna should net you a few solutions that night work for you . update to describe example test usage : placed own media files on a device capable of decoding and rendering them into video ( or still image or audio only ) . in dlna speak this was the server . for testing i used an mp4 file on an android tablet . used a product supporting dlna ( for example a dlna-certified controller device , a mobile device with dlna software installed or even your pc ) as the dlna controller . this might be the same device as the server . in my test case it was . i used the same android tablet to both serve and control the media content ( mainly to ameliorate local network performance issues ) . i had to install a free app called skifta to do the dlna controlling magic . in dlna speak , the xbox one was the renderer . the controller device 's dlna software identified the xbox os as a potential renderer in a list of output devices . my android tablet was also listed as a possible output device . using the dlna software on the controller device , selected the server as the media source and a list or tree of possible media files appeared . in testing i was able to select and play an mp4 video , scroll through a folder of jpeg images like a manual slide show and also able to play an mp3 audio file .
adding {fuse:x} to the end of the command will add a custom fuse time however , x can only be replaced by numbers up to 127 , 128 and above will detonate the tnt instantly . here 's an example : /summon PrimedTnt &lt;relative coords&gt; {Fuse:&lt;amount of ticks&gt;} 
there is no horse armour currently , because there is no mounted combat in skyrim . it may be released as dlc , as todd howard ( jokingly ? ) said that it might be released as dlc like oblivion .
boss ' health and the number of enemies per wave scale with the number of characters actively being played . you can observe this by the number of enemies next wave changing when a new player joins during build phase . character levels have no effect on difficulty in the game . you get the exact same enemy health and number of enemies if you are playing the same map/difficulty with a level 10 character or a level 70 character .
yes , it will still be playable if you still have ps+ membership . source : own experience with Plants vs. Zombies edit : as fluttershy says , it will only work if you " purchase " the game
" we need money " - solve this one first . this message means there are residential workers which cannot find work . switch to residential view and look for the buildings with low money bars . add industrial zones to your city for workers from those buildings to reach . another possibility is traffic ( even foottraffic ) . each worker makes two trips . they start in the residential building that spawns them and travel to the closest place of work ( industry , commercial , service or specialization ) . after work is complete they travel from work to the closest place of residence to drop off the money . workers do not return to their residence of origin . as buildings fill up , the next workers move to the next building - musical chairs style . if workers do not make it back to residential buildings before the next shift ( 6 o'clock ) - they will start occupying the void left by that shift . this means that some buildings may not get returning workers - and will not get money . watch worker return paths and clear up traffic . a clear thru road can get a car from one corner of the map to the other corner in 30 minutes . " shopper unsatisfied " - this means that a residential shopper cannot find a commercial building with a matching wealth level that has goods . first - goods : switch to commercial view . at 6am and 6pm goods will automatically generate at the commercial buildings . the shoppers will come from their residential buildings and buy those goods . if the all of the commercial buildings run out of goods , then you are left with unsatisfied shoppers . add more commercial buildings . note : if you have sold out of goods at 5:30 pm , but have not sold out of goods at 5:30 am , you should instead add park capacity to satisfy those daytime shoppers . most parks are open during the day and closed at night . if you add commercial instead , you will wind up with unsold goods at night because there are fewer shoppers at night . side note : goods have nothing to do with freight . they are two independent systems . second - wealth matching : residential agents have a wealth level . the store they buy goods from must match that wealth level . click on population at the bottom of your screen and switch to details to see the numbers of each wealth class of shopper . most likely , you have some $$ residential shoppers , but no $$ commercial districts . add some parks near some commercial buildings to cause them to upgrade to $$ . then your $$ shoppers will go there .
you could try copying the game files to the appropriate folder in steamapps . i would think that steam would recognize most of the files as the ones it is expecting . the copy you would do is something along the lines of C:\Program Files\Valve\Team Fortress 2\ ---&gt; C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\~grigorgevorgyan\team fortress 2\ of course , some of these files are bound to be wrong ( like the . exe - the standalone will not have the steam hooks ) . so , go to steam and tell it to " verify local game files . . . " and wait for it to redownload the different items .
suppression does not prevent move-block abilities from having their normal effect . malzahar 's ultimate has a leash range , it is possible to cancel a friendly malzahar 's ultimate by pulling the target out of leash range . if your move block does not place the victim outside of leash range , malzahar 's ultimate will complete as normal . warwick 's ultimate does not have a leash range ( but see below ) . if you move his victim , he will continue to channel and deal damage while appearing to savage thin air . this youtube shows a blitz grab connecting shortly after skarner 's ultimate begins : skarner 's ultimate will not be broken by move-block abilities - instead , it will override the move black shortly after it begins with its own effect . eta : xypherous recently announced planned changes to malzahar and warwick 's ultimates : we are doing a change ( or a bugfix , depending on your point of view ) on both warwick and malzahar . their ultimates will be treated like leashes . . . because they kind of are . ( you can not qss leashes . you can only break them via distance . ) what this means is that qss will break the stunning effect on you but until you get out of range of them , it will not cancel the damage and other effects these characters will be doing . malzahar will get his full nether grasp until they break the leash and warwick typically gets 2 ( maybe 3 ) more swipes before the target walks away .
the game 's save data is contained in two files , both of which need to be moved between computers in order to get everything migrated properly . these files are so . sol and serial . txt . i have a mac and a windows machine , so i will go ahead and list the location of said files on both platforms ( if anyone has any linux info , feel free to chip in ) . on the pc : serial . txt : can be found in the game 's steam installation folder , something along the lines of C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\the binding of isaac\  so . sol : can be found over at %appdata%\Macromedia\Flash Player\#SharedObjects\&lt;some random string&gt;\localhost\  the " random string " bit is some combination of letters and numbers which is impossible to predict . assuming you have ever run the game , simply search for " so . sol " at "%appdata%\macromedia\flash player#sharedobjects " ( you can type this in your run prompt to get there ) . on my machine i have several so . sol files , but only one is on a path that looks exactly like the one i specified , and that is the one that counts . on the mac : serial . txt : can be found in the game 's steam installation folder , something along the lines of ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/the binding of isaac/  so . sol : much like the pc , only over at ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/#SharedObjects/&lt;some random string&gt;/localhost/  as a final note , i will stress again that you need to move both files , and that you need to launch the game at least once on the target machine to know where they should go . the binding of issac cannot support steam cloud as it is a flash game and is not allowed to access the local filesystem except for using per site storage ( or local shared objects , see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/local_shared_object ) . it is impossible for the game to use steam cloud while it is running in the flash player ( as opposed to air or some other language ) .
so it took a little bit of time but i solved that problem . red = input blue = output green = redstonedust orange = special event :o rightclick on the picture and press show picture to enlarge the image . the problem you have is to block the input from the button for a specific time . i used a piston for that . the pisten blocks the redstone signal . the thing on the upper right keeps the signal active . that means that the pisten is moving the block over the redstone and the butten is doing nothing anymore . rightclick on the picture and press show picture to enlarge the image . how you are able to build such a thing you find here ! further more you need a thing that activate the button if the ( for example 10 - 20 secounds ) time is over . for that you need the special creation from uncle gerret that is to the upper left . rightclick on the picture and press show picture to enlarge the image . you can make this as long as you want to and also delay each repeater as you want to . you can make whatever delay you want . if you put a repeater on four ticks it is a delay of 0,4 secounds . that means you need 50 repeater in a row to delay the time for 20 secounds . one more screenshot from the back and you should be able to build that little thing . rightclick on the picture and press show picture to enlarge the image . do not forget the reapeater next to the piston otherwise something crazy will happen . . . keep in mind that i was ignoring the place . you coul'd put my solution in a smaller space than i have done . . . here is a example how you could place the repeater for less space usage ( 20 secounds delay ) : it is just a little bit bigger than in the pictures above . . .
what can be won in the arena ? you get up to 5 rewards on completing 12 wins or 3 losses . one reward will be a card pack . the other one to four rewards are random ( dust , gold , single cards ) . more wins = more and better random rewards . what is the minimum price received when loosing 3 times ? you always get your card pack . the worst random reward is "5 dusts " . however , there is mmr matching in arena . you should expect to win at least one game on average even if you are terrible at picking cards . when accumulating gold through daily 's what is the best way spend this gold ? dailies in play mode generate 1 pack per ~3 games . arenas generate 1 pack per 5-15 games played . games in play mode without dailies generate 1 pack per 30 wins ( now limited to 1 per day ) . there is two extremes of player here : some players complete the dailies and log off , sometimes going for multiple dailies at once ( 3 or fewer games per day ) . on the other extreme , others play at least two hours or more each day ( 8 or more games per day ) . if you value your time highly ( as the first group does ) , doing the dailies in play mode generates more gold than arenas . arena purchases would not get used , so packs should be purchased instead . you may want to set aside 300 gold in case you get an extra burst of playtime so you can arena on those days . if you value your time playing at a net of zero ( as the second group does ) , doing arenas generates more packs than play mode .

update : this works with both the steam and origin version of the game , and has gotten easier to do than from my original post . there is no additional plugin you need to install or forum threads to monitor . first , you need to go to this site and download the program found there , called widescreen fixer . there is a . 7z file you need to download . you will need a program like winrar or 7-zip to open and extract the files . extract the files anyplace you like . now , open the " widescreen fixer . exe " in the main widescreen fixer directory . in the dropdown list you should see kingdoms of amalur listed : at this point , click the standard " config " wheel to the right of the drop-down : change the game version to the steam 1.0.1 option ( the most recent patch ) if you are using steam , and the origin 1.0.1 option if you are using origin , and then select your field of view options . i have mine set to 90 and it is much better , but you could go even higher if you wanted . then , set your resolution to the resolution of your monitor ( 1920x1080 , etc . ) , by default it should auto-detect your resolution . save your settings and close this window . if you click on the " settings " tab in the main window fixer , at the bottom you will see the following dialogue : you can click your mouse in the box that says " add " and press a key which will tell " widescreen fixer " to activate the fix once you are in the game . from here , start koa:r from your respective location ( steam or origin ) . now , once at the main menu , press the key you set it to above , i believe the default is the " multiply " key on the numpad . then , start your game as normal . as soon as you start moving around you should see the field of view move out . here are some in game shots of my rather low level mage , with and without this fix : the default field of view : the field of view set to "90" through the widescreen fixer at 1920x1080 with my character standing at the exact same spot looking in the same direction : it makes quite the difference ! i have not had much time to test if this creates graphical artifacts or not . from what i can tell most of the artifacts have been corrected since my initial answer to this question . since it is turned on via the " widescreen fixer " program , it is easy enough to disable if you decide you do not like it . simply hit the key to turn it on again to turn it off when back at the menu screen , or exit the game and do not run widescreen fixer this time . you can always just remove the widescreen fixer directory if you do not like the use this . in addition , as the game is patched , it may stop this fov fix from working , so you may need to update the widescreen fixer program in the event that happens . additional note about the security concerns involved with widescreen fixer ( based on the comments ) : i received word from the creator of the widescreen fixer program ( david rudie ) that the program does not in any way try to access the internet . in the 2 . x versions of the code the check box you see in the interface tried to do auto-updating but did not work correctly , so that code was removed but the check box is still there in the 3 . x versions of the program . in addition , he says : a couple of users reported issues that widescreen fixer would crash on launch . after looking into their error messages it turns out that microsoft will mark certain things downloaded from the internet as remote , even if it is stored locally . users then have to right-click on the . exe file , get properties , and then unblock it . all i can say for sure is that nothing in the code accesses the internet . hopefully anyone who wants to use this fix that was concerned about security issues ( windows 7 did not prompt me for any firewall access but users in the comments reported that some dedicated firewall programs did ) will have their concerns put to rest .
this is a pretty complicated subject , and the various wikis have a lot more detailed information about them . in general , you are ranked from +0 to +3 in your current covenant ; some covenants give items or other benefits for attaining ranks , and joining some covenants will let you use covenant-specific items and miracles . they are pretty complicated ( no two are alike , really , beyond the fact that you can only ever be in one at a given time ) , but here 's a summary of the stuff you can get : way of white : no items or ranks , but it does seem to make co-op easier ( you see more white soapstone signs as a human ) warrior of sunlight : gain the use of the lightning spear miracle for joining , greater lightning spear miracle at rank 2 , seekrit spoiler miracle in ng+ . makes co-op easier , and gives you a golden white soapstone sign ( like solaire of astora ) . rank up by delivering sunlight medals to the sunlight altar ; you can gain the medals by defeating bosses in co-op ( you do not have to be in the covenant to get them ) . oh and you also get a gesture for joining ( praise the sun ! ) princess 's guard : no ranks , but you get the ring of the sun princess and the soothing and bountiful sunlight miracles . makes co-op easier , too . note that unlike most covenant miracles , you do not actually need to be in the princess 's guard to use those two , and you can get them from other places . path of the dragon : gain the everlasting dragon eye and dragon head stone for joining , along with an upgraded estus flask - you always get at least 10 charges , even if you are resting at a bonfire that has not been kindled . the dragon head stone gives you a dragon 's head when you use it , and lets you use a fire breath attack . every rank in the covenant upgrades the fire breath attack . you also gain the dragon stone torso at rank 2 . this covenant is mostly for dueling , as the everlasting dragon eye lets you challenge other members of the covenant to a fight ; the winner ( or both , if a tie ) receives a dragon scale . gravelord servant : gain the gravelord 's sword item and the gravelord 's sword dance miracle for joining , as well as the ability to use eyes of death ( and generate more of them , if you use them properly ) . gain the gravelord 's greatsword dance at rank 2 . forest hunter : gain the cat covenant ring and access to a merchant for joining ; the npcs in the forest behind the crest-locked door will not attack you any more ( you can not talk to them , and attacking them breaks the covenant ) . gain a ( single , consumable ) divine blessing at rank 2 , and the ring of fog at rank 3 . wearing the cat covenant ring will cause you to occasionally be summoned to the forest , in order to defend it against players . defeating these players will improve your rank in the covenant . note that breaking this covenant is pretty much the only way to gain the dark wood grain ring ( which lets you do flippin ' sweet backflips ) , as the only one in the game is carried by the merchant 's bodyguard . blade of the darkmoon : gain the blue eye orb and the darkmoon covenant ring for joining . the blue eye orb lets you invade and attack players who have " sinned " , and wearing the darkmoon covenant ring will occasionally summon you to attack players who have done a bad thing , much like the cat covenant ring . successfully killing the target of either of these will grant you a souvenir of reprisal , which you use to rank up in the covenant . at rank 1 you gain the darkmoon talisman and the darkmoon blade . darkwraith : gain the dark hand for joining , which lets you steal humanity from other players and npcs . gain the red eye orb at rank 1 ( an unlimited use version of the cracked red eye orb ) , and the dark sword + dark armor set at rank 2 . chaos servant : gain the great chaos fireball pyromancy for joining , and the chaos storm pyromancy + a shortcut to lost izalith at rank 2 ( note that this shortcut is the only covenant-specific area ) .
yes , the controller will work with windows rt-games , because windows will recognize the pad , no matter if it is windows 7 , 8 , 8.1 or rt . even windows phone works . have a look at this youtube-video covering windows rt ( surface ) + xbox 360 controller . this channel has some other rt-videos too ( i.e. . usb-tests and more ) . i may be wrong , but i think you can even navigate through the tiles on windows 8/8.1 with the gamepad . keep in mind that the games need to support a gamepad .
there are 16 that give rewards , however one ( part of the thieve 's guild questline ) requires you to give it back to complete the quest ( skeleton key ) there are 3 missions that give you non-equippable artefacts , 3 that give you staves , 5 that relinquish melee weapons , 4 that give you armour ( and shields ) and 2 that give you rings . ( one mission can give you a ring or a chest piece , but i will elaborate ) if you do them right , you can avoid getting arrested for all of them , and possibly even get more items than you are technically allowed ( by way of glitches ) for example , in " ill met by moonlight " you have a choice for a reward : the ring of hircine or the savior 's hide . however , sometimes , the game glitches out and upon completion of the quest ( when trying for the ring ) sinding will reappear in the cell you first found him , in werewolf form . killing him will relent the savior 's hide . ( this is tricky through the bars of the cell , but with timing and a save beforehand , you should prevail ) on the other hand , the oghma infinium has it is own glitch that will allow you to level up indiefinitely by use of a bookshelf . here is a quick guide on how to go about it . ( this may have been patched ) . for the remainder , i believe that all of the daedric artifacts are quite op , my favourite listing as the dawnbreaker ( burns undead , and causes explosions on death that causes undead to flee ) , mehrune 's razor ( has a small chance for an insta-kill , which works on all enemies ) , and all of the rings are quite good as well . i personally prefer the ring of hircine , as i enjoy playing as a werewolf . so to round up , yes . they are worth it .
the first few times i played , i followed the quickstart guide from the dwarf fortress wiki , located here . it is extremely helpful , and walks you through the ui , controls , and world generation , as well as getting a fortress started . there is also an e-book : getting started with dwarf fortress . there was a coupon code for 40% off , but i can not remember what it was , and i am not sure if it is still active . if i find it , i will add it here .
bookshelves need to be placed no more than two blocks away from the enchanting table horizontally , and must be vertically either on the same level as the table , or one level up . bookshelves increase the number of levels you can dump into an enchantment , increasing the chances that the enchantment you get is a good one . 15 bookshelves caps this effect . it should look like this when finished .
before i jump into the maps , i have some words of advice when it comes to gta online 's survival mode : advice : running for health/armor/ammo mid-round is suicidal once the round starts and bullets start flying , stay put and stay in cover ! do not get cocky and try to go rambo on all the npcs . . . you will be brought down in a matter of seconds . the only time you can run-and-gun is early on ( wave 3 at the maximum ) . it can be very tempting to leave your spot and stock up , but it is important to remember survival punishes carelessness and rewards patience . remember enemy spawn points in survival , you can die in seconds , so always be aware of enemy spawn points . i cannot tell you how many times i have been shotgunned in the back at the start of a round just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time . leave stragglers at the end of each wave in this mode , people get shot , fall down , and bleed out . best way to stock up before each wave is to shoot the last npc in the leg or body ( i recommend a pistol or smg depending on the wave you are on ) . that gives you vital time to grab any and all the goodies you can before the next wave starts . use blindfire ! ! ( holding rt or r2 ) you rarely see people blindfiring . during the later waves ( when it is you vs 30 npcs w/ miniguns ) , getting out of cover is pretty much a death-sentence . you can have full health/armor and the moment you try locking-on , you are nearly dead . this is where blindfiring comes in . blindfiring is surprisingly accurate and it takes very little to injure an enemy and have them " bleed-out " . you can even take down helicopters by blindfiring . if you press up on the left stick when behind cover of a certain height , you can aim your blind fire . just remember , there are times when you should lock-on and there are times when you should not . fun tips : helicopters spawn on waves 4 , 7 , and 10 . they always spawn on waves with rocket launchers . you can heal yourself with the snacks you pickup and buy at the store . this can give you full health when you need it the most ! do this by opening up the Interaction Menu , go to Inventory , and select one of the various snacks at the bottom of the list ( p and qs , ego chaser , meteorite bar , or ecola ) . to open the Interaction Menu , hold back or select you can do combat rolls by holding down lt or l2 and pressing x or &#9633 ; ( note : must have a gun in hand ; you cannot roll unarmed or with grenades ) helicopters kill themselves off after a certain amount of time ! if you are too nervous and/or lazy to shoot down the helicopters , just wait it out for about 10 min of it spawning - the chopper will land and die off :-d . you can call in merryweather for assistance 1 ) boneyard minimum recommended players : 2 best location : behind the trailer ( across from the barn ) strategy : without question , this is the easiest survival map . there is a trailer near the player spawn point . get behind it , take one side ( your friend get the other ) and watch as all the enemies come to you . helicopters can not touch you and enemies can not flank you . you will almost always win if you stay put . fun tip : if you need health , you can always use the soda machine inside the barn ( costs $1 ) . 2 ) railyard survival minimum recommended players : 2 to 3 best location : the red traincar strategy : head to the back of the red traincar . your friend gets on one side and you , the other . you are safe from helicopters and enemies always come to you . overall , nothing too difficult . just make sure to use blindfire when the odds are stacked against you ! 3 ) sandy survival minimum recommended players : 3 to 4 best location : behind the dumpster strategy : the best area on this map is the dumpster . helicopters can not hit you and enemies will constantly go out of cover to try to get to you . however , be wary of enemies trying to run around the dumpster , which happens at least once a wave . at close-range , enemies can kill you in one shot . my suggestion is to focus on your mini-map whenever an enemy is close , aim over the dumpster , shoot them in the head ; however you can also immediately pistol-whip them , but that is not always a sure thing . always keep your eyes on the mini-map , constantly be on your toes , and you should be good ! 4 ) processed minimum recommended players : 3 to 4 best location : in the back of the building ( in a red dumpster or behind cars ) strategy : the best area is in the back of the building with the broken down cars . have one person go into a red dumpster and the other behind the cars . helicopters are not an issue on this map . the biggest nuisance stems from enemy spawn points : this map has the worst enemy spawn points of all the maps . be aware of your surroundings , otherwise you may get shot in the back of the head . 5 ) sawmill plant minimum recommended players : 3 to 4 players best location : in a red dumpster under the plant ( north-side of the map ) : strategy : there are a number of places that are decent on this map , but without question , the red dumpster is the best . you are safe from helicopters and enemies will literally fall from the roof trying to get you like a pack of zombies ( very funny ) . also enemies will approach you from a distance , so you have plenty of time to shoot them on their way over to you . you can share the inside of the dumpster with another person and a third can hug the outside . 6 ) del perro pier survival minimum recommended players : 3 to 4 players best location : the bathroom near the ferris wheel : strategy : if you plan on staying in the bathroom , you need another person to get your back since you are close to two enemy spawn points : ground units spawn here cars spawn here one person should hug the wooden wall ( watch the first enemy spawn point ) and the other should hug the side of a vending machine ( watch for any cars ) . it is important that both of you keep your heads on a constant swivel before jumping out of cover . fortunately , you are safe from helicopters so the main pressure will come from ground units . if things get really bad , you can always fall back into the bathroom and shoot any oncoming units with your shotgun . i also recommend planting sticky bombs around the area in case you get overrun . 7 ) industrial plant minimum recommended players : 4 experienced players best location : the very top of the industrial plant ( note : this spot is very vulnerable to helicopters ) : the blue dumpster close to the player spawn area : strategy : undeniably the hardest survival map . unfortunately , there is no " go-to " spot on this map , since they all pretty much have their pros and cons . helicopters are the primary threat on this map , so they need to be your top priority . helpful tips : get each other 's backs ! you need to work as a team , otherwise , you are doomed . play with people you know ! from my experience , randoms just make it harder ( that is what she said ) focus on helicopters the moment they appear . have a friend focus on ground units , while you take out the choppers . i hope this helps and let me know if you need anything else ! good luck ! !
torches are dropped by certain enemies , and can also be found in fixed locations in the game world ( from chests , corpses , et cetera ) . every torch you find will add 5 minutes to your torch timer , located inside the equipment menu . torch wielding enemies seem to have a high chance of dropping a torch , and there are a few of them located inside the gutter . you can proceed through the gutter just fine without a torch , so i would not bother backtracking to try and get another torch .
i mixed a grim cap , blooddrop blossom ( the descritions says : witches of the north use them in dark rituals . ) and a cave nettle . what i get is a sulphurous potion ( rage : attack power +10 , evasion -10 ) . maybe this is meant ?
actually , if you look here the in-game destroyer does have rear guns . looking over some of your suggested american designs , i noticed the numbering scheme used and searched wikipedia for dd-443 ( the number on the hull of the destroyer 's icon ) , and came up with the gleaves-class destroyer ( specifically the uss swanson ) personally , i think they look rather close enough to call it a match .
the places i have visited suggest that there are 5 bottles in the game : kakariko merchant ( hyrule ) - there is a merchant in this village that will sell you a bottle for 100 rupees under the bridge ( hyrule ) - with zora flippers , there is a stone bridge to the right of link 's house . talk to the man who lives under the bridge to receive a bottle message in a bottle ( hyrule ) - with zora flippers , go east of lake hylia , where you can find an empty bottle . this will give you a quest involving filling the bottle with premium milk from kakariko village and delivering it to a man who is lost on death mountain vacant house ( lorule ) - go to link 's house in lorule and bomb the back of the house . enter , and find a chest containing a bottle great rupee fairy ( lorule ) - in the lorule fairy fountain , you will find a giant crack near it . bomb it with the bomb flower , and then donate 3,000 rupees to the fairy sources : http://segmentnext.com/2013/11/22/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-empty-bottles-locations/ http://www.zeldauniverse.net/zelda/albw-bottles/ http://www.zeldainformer.com/walkthrough/page/collectibles-guide
yes , you can store more than one key in the same or in different capsules . this enables you to not drop keys anymore to get more from hacks .
here 's a video that shows a strategy for level 12 players : the basic strategy appears to be to focus on defense when zeto uses call wave , as that indicates he will be doing a powerful attack the next round . after this attack , focus on healing first before you return to dealing damage . this faq suggests the following combos to deal damage : vahn should simply do : right , right , left , right , right left . noa has an awesome seven slot combo : down , up , up , up , left , down , right . gala should just use the neo rising move : left , left , right , up left .
power armor training in fo:nv is available at the end of a few different quest chains in order to provide access for a variety of paths . from the brotherhood : after completing eyesight to the blind or still in the dark , wait 24 hours for the lockdown to end , and the elder will offer you pa:training , whether mcnamara , or hardin . ( hardin may ask you to go blow up the silver rush before offering training . ) alternately , you can complete arcade gannon 's follower quest , for auld lang syne - in addition to rewarding you with the unique tesla power armor , you will receive the necessary training to use it .
i can understand how frustrating this must be as my research has indicated that the game turns it off quite frequently without warning or indication . you are not alone in your question as saintsrow.com's forum has a thread full of users with the same concerns . from the responses of the many users there and a few elsewhere , it would appear that no user has found a way to lock camera mode as enabled or if they have , they never shared it . from this , it seems probable that there is no way to do it on console . pc versions with modding might be able to find a way around the problem , but for the xbox 360 version , it would seem you are out of luck .
in the case you show , the second arrangement will grant you a greater bonus than the first . with links represented by lines , in the first arrangement : X-X-X-X  there are three links . in the second arrangement : X-X | | X-X  there are four links . for every two adjacent facilities , you will get the adjacency bonus , and a building can be in multiple adjacency pairs .
a tech burst is basically an elemental combo that can be caused by using 2 of the following powers : overload , energy drain , sabotage and disruptor ammo . tech burst is like other elemental combo attacks , such as cryo or fire . to detonate , use any biotic or tech combat powers that deal direct damage . hope this helps !
finally figured it out . stand up straight with your right arm down to your side and lift your left are straight in the air .
you have to get there from level four . there is an alcove in the corridor that leads from the area with the pressure-plate puzzles ( the " trials of thought" ) to the four-way intersection where you find the scrolls after each test . in this alcove there is a hidden switch , hit it and bolt into the intersection where some of the holes will be temporarily covered with trapdoors . in the south-east corner of the room ( the only corner you can reach ) there is yet another hidden switch that will shut of the center ( return ) portal , allowing you to drop down into the locked room below . the timing on all of this is pretty tight , so you might want to start by looking around the intersection to make sure you know where you are going . mess it up , and you will fall down and will have to redo the trials of thought to get back . if you are ok with spoilers , the alcove is number 7 on this map .
nope . unless you wanted to work around the game 's code , premium characters and worlds will cost you a pretty penny . even if you were going to manipulate the code , i am not sure if the data for the premium content is even there to be accessed .
according to wikipedia , there are 3 act + 1 boss battle per zone , 4 main zones , and one hidden zone . so i would assume there are 20 levels in total . episode 1 has four main zones ; splash hill , casino street , lost labyrinth , and mad gear , inspired by classic zones from sonic 1 and sonic 2 . each zone contains three acts followed by a boss battle , which are similar to boss battles from older sonic games , but with variations added . levels can either be accessed in any order via a world map , or played continuously one after the other . once all zones are cleared , players can access the final zone , e.g.g. station .
i have experienced this and in my case i believe it is because when i am lost i will start to run around the map ( using the run function if there is one ) looking for something familiar or some enemy i have not killed . all this running means a lot of turning around and thus a lot of visual input . the result is a motion-sickness like feeling . your mileage may vary .
queens near hatcheries do not cause larvae to spawn , but the difficulty level on the campaign does affect the amount of larvae produced .
increasing your skills makes you more effective in their use . the way in which this happens vary by skill . in the case of the various schools of magic , it comes in the form of reducing the magicka cost of higher level spells , allowing you to cast more powerful alternatives to your earlier weaker ones . most of the weapon/armor skills manifest as direct damage/damage reduction increases that you will see when you attempt to equip the related items . . increasing crafting skills increases the potency of the product created . more powerful potions/enchants , and better smithing upgrades at a workbench . increasing speechcraft and sneak , and pickpocket improves your chance of success when using those skills , and , in the case of speechcraft , improves the prices you will get from merchants . increasing lock picking increases the size of the ' sweet spot ' when picking locks and increases the number of failed attempts before breaking a pick .
for some skills , the runes really change the behavior and are not a flat-out bonus , so for these skills then yes , if that is the only rune available then there is a reason not to rune it . for example , see my question regarding does impending doom decreases exploding palm&#39 ; s dps ? a case where it is the only rune available is , for example , with elemental arrow . the first rune decreases the projectile 's speed , so if you do not want that then you will have to wait until the next rune , 5 levels later . so for 5 levels you will have a reason not to rune the skill . but the overwhelming majority of runes do not change the inherent skill behavior , only add to it , and they are a clear upgrade .
the scania r730 , with 730 horsepower , is the highest . it is unlocked at level 25 and you can buy it in milano ( italy ) , hannover ( germany ) or manchester ( england ) for 212.430 euros .
this is just a unique ' magic ' quality item . from the information available at the moment this just seems to be a flavour item with no other purpose in the game . ( falling under the ' easter egg ' category ) . it is worth noting that during beta this item was classified as a legendary item according to gamona , but is still reported as a legendary item by other sites claiming to be up to date , such as d3db . this question is a duplicate of why does this item have a legend ? are there others like it ?
no . at no point has herobrine been a part of minecraft . it is a running gag to have herobrine removed every couple of revisions .
you cannot disenchant items from trying to enchant them . they ( thankfully ) removed this aspect in the game . you can remove the enchantments you paid to put but it removes them all . for example , say you find a pistol with +4 mana . you pay an enchanter twice to add enchantments and get +4 electric damage and +2 strength . you decide you do not want those so you pay him to disenchant it . the +4 electric damage and +2 strength are removed , the original +4 mana stays . some enchanters can only do a max of 2 enchantments , like the enchanter you can get in town . you may run into other enchanters in dungeons or on the overworld which can do 3 or 4 . check out this enchanting article on the wiki for more information
short answer : no . long answer : the reason is fairly simple . you will fall behind in income . if you fall behind in income they will be able to make more units/tech up more than you . this will win your opponent the game in the long run . think of it this way , if you have more money , you can get more stuff . now keep in mind that you might want to keep enough energy for one scan just in case you need detection for a cloaked banshee , but with proper scouting of your opponent you will know if you can spend the energy on a scan or a mule . you will always want to use mules to keep your income up , ideally dropping them at your expansions before your main . the reason for this is to extend the time that you can keep mining from your main base which is generally more secure . if you end up mining out your expansion quicker it is not a big deal because it is a more exposed position so you want to gain as much as you can from it in the shortest amount of time .
based on a rough timeline of the data i collected , there are 23 points during the game that have to be hit to complete all the conversation achievements and , because of dependencies , they need to be hit in order . when talking to someone , you are expected to complete all their available conversations before moving on to talk to someone else , but i only count the conversations that count towards achievements despite there being additional extra conversations available . i will try to group conversations to cut down travel time , making this pretty close to the fewest stops with the least travel , but there is probably some room for optimization once all dependencies are mapped out . do not worry about avoiding people with asterisks because you will get those conversations later and this way involves less running around . i will go through and confirm specifics and nuances later to determine if there are inconsistencies to timing and number of conversations based on current objective and dependencies . act i the fallen star - rumford at the gates : takes you right to town . talk to haedrig and then leah for 1 conversation each . the legacy of cain - begin quest : talk to leah to begin the quest . talk to haedrig and then leah for 1 conversation each . a shattered crown - begin quest : talk to haedrig for 1 conversation . talk to deckard cain to begin the quest and then talk to leah for 2 conversations , deckard cain for 4 conversations and then covetous shen for 4 conversations . reign of the black king - the royal crypts : talk to haedrig for 2 conversations and then covetous shen for 1 conversation . deckard cain has a conversation that you get by completing the quest , but you should have this one already since you beat the game - if you want to re-listen to it , you can get it at the next point . sword of the stranger - khazra den : talk to the stranger for 1 conversation , then deckard cain for 2 conversations , and then covetous shen for 1 conversation . the broken blade - talk to alaric : talk to the stranger for 1 conversation . you will need to run through the act a bit to get leah 's 2 conversations as she follows you , 1 while collecting beacons and 1 at the drowned temple . the doom in wortham - begin quest : talk to deckard cain for his last 4 conversations , and haedrig and covetous shen for 1 conversation each . talk to the stranger to begin the quest . talk to the stranger again and then covetous shen for 1 conversation each . trailing the coven - khazra barricade : talk to leah and then covetous shen for 1 conversation each . the imprisoned angel - the cursed hold : talk to covetous shen for 1 conversation . return to new tristram - begin quest : talk to tyrael twice , haedrig , and then covetous shen for 1 conversation each . act ii a royal audience - begin quest : talk to eirena for 3 conversations , haedrig for 3 conversations and then covetous shen for 6 conversations . blood and sand - begin quest : talk to leah for 3 conversations , adria for 9 conversations , tyrael for 8 conversations , and covetous shen for 1 conversation . the black soulstone - realm of shadow : waypoint to the archives of zoltun kulle and talk to leah for 1 conversation . the scouring of caldeum - begin quest : talk to adria , haedrig and covetous shen for 3 conversations each . act iii the siege of bastion 's keep - light the beacons : talk to tyrael for 2 conversations . town portal . talk to haedrig for 3 conversations . turning the tide - begin quest : talk to tyrael to begin the quest . talk to tyrael for 4 conversations and haedrig for 1 conversation . enter the armory and talk to adria for 2 conversations and leah for 3 conversations . the breached keep - find the breach : talk to tyrael for 3 conversations and kormac for 11 conversations . tremors in the stone - begin quest : talk to lieutenant lavail to begin the quest . talk to haedrig for 1 conversation and covetous shen for 7 conversations . machines of war - destroy ballistae : talk to haedrig and covetous shen for 1 conversation each . enter the armory and talk to adria for 1 conversation . heart of sin - the second heart : talk to haedrig for 1 conversation and covetous shen for 2 conversations . act iv fall of the high heavens - begin quest : talk to tyrael several times for 3 conversations . use the nearby waypoint to bastion 's keep stronghold . talk to kormac for 4 conversations , lyndon for 14 conversations , eirena for 8 conversations , and covetous shen for 3 conversations . beneath the spire - begin quest : talk to haedrig for 2 conversations and covetous shen for 3 conversations . prime evil - enter the crystal arch : talk to lyndon for 1 conversation , eirena for 2 conversations and covetous shen for 1 conversation . use the waypoint to go to the pinnacle of heaven and talk to tyrael for 5 conversations .
skyrim is not like oblivion they caught onto such things so when you cast a spell it must do something so to level up conjuration you must engage in battle with your artronach . afaik the only spell that you can cast over and over is " muffle " a second tier illusion spell that " muffles the sound of your footsteps " so you can spam that while arround npcs and lvl it .
from this steam thread : level up districts ( city expansion tile ) and cities instead of making lines of unleveled districts . to level a district or a city , surround it with 4 other districts research +approval technologies and buildings use luxury goods that improve approval use influence for approval kingdom bonus in addition to that , some anomalies like the spiral rock peel will provide approval bonuses .
turns out tenfour 's advice in the comments under the question was correct . i am sure some static defenses at our natural ( s ) ( or at the a choke ahead of our naturals ) would also work , but cutting stalkers in favour of zealots , making better use of force fields , and chronoboosting out the second immortal works a charm with either roaches or speedlings . i have not tested it , but i suspect just cutting stalkers in favour of zealouts would do the job on its own . we can hold the initial push now even if one of us screws something up . once you have held off that push , the hard ai is basically beaten . we are working now on both the very hard ai , and on getting the confidence to start on the ladder . thanks ! @tenfour : if you post your comment as an answer , i will delete this one and accept yours instead .
the green plus sign is the adjacency bonus . the more of these you have between workshops , the bigger the rebate you are going to get . building a facility other than a workshop next to your workshops will not benefit you . as the tooltip says , you will get rebates depending on the number of your adjacency bonuses when building vehicles , facilities and foundry projects .
shoot a goliath 's helmet off to anger him and immediately he will begin attacking the closest enemy near him to level himself up , even his allies . goliaths require more enemies to kill to progress to the next level as they become stronger . when they level up , they deal increased damage and replenish their health . aside from the achievement , the beneficial aspects of allowing a goliath to level is that their dropped loot will be more valuable and the experience from the enemies they killed is tripled and added to their own .
you can not return to previous areas like in the original bioshock . the only option is to load a previous auto save and re-play the level . achievement counters ( kills per gun , voxophones , etc . ) work across saves , so you can go to old saves to work on achievements if you want .
the high impact payload does work against colossi ! but it is not worth using since the ground weapons is a lot more effective against a colussus
in act 3 half way up rakkis crossing . look for a npc named captain haile . he will start the event .
unfortunately , it is difficult to give you a definitive answer given that situations vary so much in eve , all you can do is try to stack cards in your favor . some things to consider though : interceptors survive on speed , get a warp scrambler , hopefully you can use it ( possibly overheated ) to turn off their mwd which will lend you a huge advantage . remember lasers do em and therm damage only , tank for it amarr are armor tanks , which makes them vulnerable to kinetic/explosive . he probably does not have that much to plug that hole . personally i would look into destroyers , they hit hard , recently were buffed , and fit with tracking mods can probably hit the quick bastard . failing that , get friends , or starve him until he goes away . fly safe !
you can use it multiple times . i have ran several on normal , nightmare and hell without losing my staff . also , when you upgrade your staff to the next level , you can still create the games from the lower levels . a nightmare staff can create a normal game .
the far future zomboss level is not available yet , which is the reason why you cannot " replay " it . unfortunately for us completionists , we get to deal with having 24/25 on the far future until an update is released . it has happened with each zomboss level since the very first ; traditionally the boss is released a week or two before the next world is opened ( which from its appearance on the world selection screen takes place in some sort of medieval setting ) . when it is available , you will see a clearly marked trail from level 24 to the boss level . the level will also be blue , unlike your screenshot where it is grey . here 's an example from the wild west world :
you have changed your gamemode to adventure . adventure mode is used to play adventure maps ( you can only break blocks with specific tools . ) to fix press esc . press open to lan , choose enable cheats . open the lan world . now press t ( to open op chat ) and type in : /gamemode 0 this will set your gamemode to survival , and should fix it .
stand as far to the right as you can . when the bottom blade trap hits the right wall , begin running straight forward . you should make it to the top .
there are a lot of differences between the two games . races that are not human - starbound has 6 playable races , with a seventh to be released in the future . space exploration - you are not limited to exploring one planet in starbound . in fact , as soon as you have the fuel you need to pilot your spaceship ( coal ) , you can leave your starting world and explore any planet you want . very different npc interaction - you will sometimes come across npc generators that will create merchants , doctors and other npcs that act like terraria npcs , but for the most part , npcs are found on worlds , and can be hostile or non-hostile , offer merchant services , and are remarkably chill about you looting their house for all its valuables but very touchy about you holding a sword . different mining system - you can mine much wider spaces in starbound , especially once you get a pick ( the multitool is useful , but weak ) . survival mechanics - unlike in terraria , you actually have to eat regular meals and keep warm , or you will die . heat sources are easy enough to craft ( though you will need better ways to stay warm on colder planets ) , and food can be a little troublesome to come across , but it is an interesting challenge nontheless . of course , there is one very key difference right now between starbound and terraria that is very important to consider . starbound is still in beta and it is still a somewhat buggy beta , with clipping issues and game-format-changing fixes and patches being applied as the beta progresses . there is a certain ' unfinished ' feel to it right now . whereas terraria has had years and years to not only be a fully released and finished game , but to have numerous patches , updates , and content additions added onto it , making it much more polished and mature . so if you are still interested in starbound , keep in mind that it is still in beta , and still in the early phases of being improved . a lot of the " higher tech " content that will set it apart from terraria has not really been implemeneted yet ( there are very few blueprints , very few high-tech crafting recipes , and what is there is still being improved upon ) , but it is forthcoming . there are a few other minor differences here and there , but these are some of the more major differences between the two games .
you can hold down your mouse when the cursor is over those Nudge buttons and press w / s / a / d / q / z ( navigation controls ) to " nudge " the corresponding selection box . the blue one nudges the blue corner , yellow one nudges the yellow corner , white one nudges the full selection box , green one nudges the selected blocks . there is really no easy way to specify coordinates , but with this function you can simply select the rough area and then move the corners to select the area you want to select .
if you hold wheat in your hands , the animals will follow you . good grief , nudging them would take forever . : ) you might also be interested in this thread about separating them into pens . better read it beforehand . ; )
i am presuming you are a low level free-to-play player , as you have mentioned both low levelled methods that are mainly used in f2p . if not , then please elaborate : ) . here are some methods : cut normal logs ( the current price is 405gp ) mine iron . quick and easy collecting ashes . burn the logs yourself then pick up ashes . willow logs are highly recommended because they are cheap . you can do this at the fist of guthix lobby . farm marigolds . you need level 2 farming and the seeds are cheap . it takes 17.5 minutes to grow and you get around 3,000 gp+ back . smelt bars . one of the very few methods to make money while smithing in f2p chop yew logs . they are currently 577gp each ( and i am presuming they are rising because of the divination update ) mine runite ore . great money , but needs 85 mining .
there are a few things you can do to accelerate levelling : dungeons use the looking for group tool to queue for dungeons . there are often quests within dungeons with good experience rewards ( the first time at least ) . dungeons also have high level mobs which will have a good rate of experience on them . loot from dungeons will also make your character more powerful , making questing easier/faster . quest wisely move out of areas once you out level them - do not feel compelled to stay and finish the story lines if your priority is levelling . pvp some people get a good rate of experience/hour by winning in battlegrounds . have a max-level character your colleagues will have advantages over you if they have access to heirlooms . as well has having excellent stats some heirlooms have bonus experience for both killing mobs and turning in quests . rest bonus make sure you are in an inn or a capital city when you log out to accrue rest bonus . gathering professions nowadays you gain experience when you gather herbs and mine ore . you can then sell the herbs/ore on the auction house and buy better items to level faster . guild perks probably the easiest action for a new player is to join a guild and take advantage of the levelling perks , especially fast track ( lvl 6 guild ) . other useful perks for levelling are mount up ( lvl 3 ) , hasty hearth ( lvl 8 ) and working overtime ( lvl 14 ) . wth thanks to @jereone for the the reminder
it looks like you are suffering a bug . according to uesp if the markarth guards do not warn you off after having investigated the inn for eltrys and you get stuck ( guards will not arrest you ) when returning to him after finding out all you can about the conspiracy , if you wander the streets and do meet the guard who warns you off and then returning to the temple , you will still get arrested ( or attempted to get arrested ) . so it looks like you need to talk to all the guards in the city . another possibility is this ( i hope this is not your problem - no way out ) : if you enter the warrens before your first talk to eltrys in shrine of talos , a nord named dryston will approach you . he will tell you that " it is time you learned a lesson " and brawl with you . once you beat him , he will not tell you that " n " is nepos the nose as you did not get this quest yet , this will lead to a bug where you can not complete this quest ' find out who " n " is ' once you read weylin 's note ( if you read it right after you find it by lock picking the weylin 's door , it will not start the quest , as you did not speak to eltrys yet ) .
every time the time turns to day , the world is in hardmode and a mechanical boss has been killed , there is a 1 in 25 chance of a solar eclipse taking place . for minimum time spent to get each solar eclipse , you would want to use midnight , wait for it to turn to daytime and see if you got one . while dawn sets the time to right when the day starts , it also skips the code that checks for solar eclipse and invasions . alternatively you could download tshock server mod and use the command they provide to instantly start the solar eclipse event .
on most ranked servers , you can kill up to 4-5 teammates , then you are kicked ( unintentional tk penalty ) . you will however be instantly kicked and also possibly banned temporarily from the game if you tk at the beginning of the round , roughly the first 10 seconds ( intentional tk penalty ) . how long you are banned depends on the server admins . half an hour is a typical duration i observe ( friends of my friend get kicked frequently :p )
the title is taken from the classmod you have equipped . there are over 100 different titles possible , so instead of writing out the whole list here , i will link to the lists of class mods on the borderlands 2 wiki . commando siren gunzerker assassin under possible skill boost on that page , the word in parentheses goes before the name of the classmod , so the title of a commando with the first mod and variant on the list would be front line engineer .
you will receive the key in chapter 6 . when you are back in grand ship , you will see a glowing object on the ground - pick it up . it is the treasure chest key , and will unlock all the blue chests . they tend to carry the best items in the game , so remember where you found them and pick ' em up .
level 11 is the max for town shops .
it is , unfortunately , the way it is supposed to be . you can not enable subtitles for voxophone records , but you can access the transcripts through the gameplay menu ( default pc key : o ) .
first of all , transmitting results does not make you lose anything . transmitting and then repeating the experiment and returning always makes you end up with more science points in the end than just performing and returning the experiment once . in the current version ( 23.5 ) each command pod can store exactly one surface sample per biome . however , the number of biomes is not limited , so you can pick up samples from multiple biomes during one mission and store them all in one pod . to gain more science out of each " surface sample from [ object ] 's [ biome ] " activity , you need multiple samples . when your lander has multiple command pods ( the hitchhiker pod counts as a pod for this purpose ) , it can store a sample of each biome in each of them , so you can retrieve more science in one mission . however , the returns are diminishing . each returned sample gives you 75% of the remaining science points . a second sample gives you 75% of the remaining 25% , so two samples give you a total of 93.75% and three samples 98.4% . you can never reach 100% , no matter how many samples you return . that means a second pod on one lander might be justified , but more pods are usually a waste of payload mass . however , when you take a sample , transmit it , take another sample , and return it , you still obtain 80% of the maximum science points which is almost as much . considering that an antenna and a few batteries and solar panels have a lot less mass than a second pod and that you likely carry that stuff anyway to transmit crew reports ( from which you can store only a single one per pod ) , this might be the more economical option .
there is no built-in controller support on the pc version of minecraft . you will need something like xpadder to change each controller input to a keyboard/mouse input in order to use a controller .
here 's a list of some changes that i have noticed a new faction was added , the sarranid sultunate . the map and faction positions have changed . there are new political options , for example if you create your own faction , you have the option of recruiting enemy lords marriage , which works differently if you are a male or female . combat has changed slightly . however , it is difficult to notice unless compared side-to-side . this affects things such as swinging animations and projectile accuracy . individual arrows , bolts , and throwing weapons can now be picked up off the environment if they miss the enemy . it is more difficult to hit enemies from horseback . in my opinion , the combat is worse . swinging your weapon is no longer as quick or as intuitive as the original . they probably made these changes to balance the multiplayer mode . the graphics are now better , though still nowhere near that of games with large development costs . there is support for custom single player battles , where you can choose the two factions and cavalry/infantry/archer ratios as well as the map and game type ( battle and siege ) . as a side note , the multiplayer mode is quite fun and i suggest you try it at least once .
the full list of what is included is here . the things that are listed as extras with elite premium and not included with the regular free account are : all future dlc daily competitions exclusive clan benefits ( exclusive emblems and tags ) pro video guides and tactics ( tutorials ? ) premium groups early access to new features upload hd videos access to call of duty elite tv . also , i answered this in another question , however the question was phrased differently .
" exploiting " is a game mechanic that will essentially knock-down/stun an opponent . to performan a successful exploit , you will first have to get your enemy into off-balance ( e . g . by blocking a heavy attack or disrupting a cast ) . once that happens , you are able to perform a heavy attack ( does not have to be fully charged ) to exploit their weakness , resulting in the mentioned stun/knockdown .
the game technically never ends because they continue to randomize quests after you have completed all of the handcrafted quests . the main quest itself is supposed to take around 30 hours for an average game .
all this message means is that no role abilities will be transfered . there are other reasons to infuse which make that warning relatively benign . a monster of a specific role can only inherit role abilities for its own role . as a general rule , each monster can possibly pass on one role ability , but not all role abilities are infusable . if your monster already has the role abilities that you are trying to infuse , there will be no role abilities that can be infused and you will be warned . if you are trying to infuse abilities from a different role , there will likewise be no role abilities to infuse and you will be warned . abilities with red locks cannot be infused . if you are trying to infuse a role ability that cannot be infused , you will be warned . here ' s a solid list of role abilities , denoting which are infusable . these are the role abilities that are infusable : even if no role abilities will be infused , this does not mean the infusion is useless . passive abilities can still be infused , even when no role abilities will . infusion can be used to soft lock some passive abilities , even when it looks like nothing is being infused at all . there are also hidden fusion abilities that can be granted from certain role combination infusions - if you infuse 99 levels worth of specific roles into specific other roles ( com&lt ; -> rav , sen&lt ; -> med , sab&lt ; -> syn ) , a hidden role auto-ability can be unlocked . you can preview the results of your infusion before you infuse when selecting the second monster . if there really is nothing to infuse , then you probably should not . you may need to use monster materials to level your monsters and learn them some new abilities in order to actually have something worth infusing .
to kill the night lights , you should avoid hitting the abdomen at all cost . aim for the head , and try to hit them with a slashing motion rather than hitting them straight , damaging the abdomen trough their head . you can kill them by hitting the abdomen without explosion if you are careful , but this is more difficult and dangerous . for explosives in general , you should be gentle if you want to deflect them or send them back . do not hit at full speed and straight on , rather try to make them rebound on you blade or catch them in a flail before flinging them away . explosives can explode before the end of their time if hit too hard .
cobblestone walls have better blast resistance and is not flammable , making it a slightly better defense against creepers and tnt , as well as making it usable near lava or fire . other than that , the difference is purely aesthetic .
first off , they are stored client-side , so you can not restore players ' waypoints on your side . they are in mods/rei_minimap in the minecraft folder . you should have a bunch of . points files in there . each file stores the waypoints for a single dimension in a world . multiplayer waypoints are stored by server address , so if your server is on a consumer machine with a dynamic ip address , you should set up a hostname for it so players do not keep losing their waypoints .
being favored in any starcraft ii match , has nothing to do with leagues . it all has to to do with the " hidden match making rating " . it determines your actual skill level based off of winning or losing to opponents at , below , or above you current determined skill . as a side note , when you raise your hmmr enough , you will get promoted to the next league . every pair of players is ranked individually . so players a+b 's team will have a ranking completely unrelated to players a+c 's team . in 2v2 random match-ups , an average rating of the two players will be compared to their opponents rating . this rule presumably applies for 3v3 and 4v4 as well .
there are quite a few ways to check if you have a genuine microsoft product . the best way to tell is to check if it has a holographic microsoft sticker on it . all genuine microsoft products have this quality ( watch this video for a demonstration of this ) in addition , you must remember that microsoft has changed the design of their controllers over time , and therefore the one that you have may be different from the one your friend has . wikipedia is helpful in identifying which controller you and your friend have . the logo should look like this . the " microsoft " logo on the top of the controller should have a split " o " and connected " ft " check the weight of the controller with another controller you are sure is real .

that is ebonstone and it can only be broken with higher tier pickaxes . from your screenshot , it looks like you have either an iron pickaxe or a silver pickaxe , neither of which are strong enough to destroy the ebonstone . it is possible to destroy before you obtain the higher tier pickaxes using one of these methods : dynamite you can find dynamite in chests , or buy it from the demolitionist if you have managed to get him to move in yet purification powder you can buy this from the dryad if you have managed to get her to move in yet ; after using the powder on the ebonstone , you will be able to mine the stone normally with your current pickaxe
notified ? no , but they can see that you are no longer in their friend 's list .
you can play on unranked servers . on unranked servers all weapons may be unlocked ( depending on server ) nothing counts towards your stats dogtags taken still count you should be able to test any weapon there .
claiming keeps and other ressources has advantages : your guild store will be accessible to all alliance members inside the keep ( they can not sell things , but they are able to buy off your guild 's supply ) . you are able to upgrade/improve the keep or ressource , e.g. making the guards more powerful , adding new guards , etc . it is some kind of status symbol as well even if this point does not have any direct gameplay impact . in daoc you typically got warnings to guild chat when/if guards of your keep died . i do not think this is in the game yet , but i could imagine them adding stuff like this later as well ( unless it is in there already , did not claim anything so far ) .
for the level ranges , check this question and the great answer there . as you noticed , magic items always give magic materials , rares always give magic+rare , and inferno legendaries will always give rare+fiery brimstone . in addition , magic items have a 15% chance to give rare materials . ( source ) it is possible to get fiery brimstone from non-legendary inferno tier items , but the drop rate is ~0.1% for rares , and even less for magic items .
no it does not . while pix is attached to you , it does not help you burn down towers . while pix is attached to an ally , it does not help them burn down towers .
the mice will pop-up several times in a level until you catch it . after that it will not show up again until the next level .
according to the forums , the chance is 25 percent . http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/12284718438
the evolution level only matters if you are holding off to get a specific moves , which in eevee 's case probably does not matter that much , unless you want take down or double edge . take a look at eevee 's and vaporeon 's learset , and see if there is anything you want to hold off evolving for . it does not impact stats at all . in other words , whether you choose to evolve at level 1 or level 100 , they will have the same stats if you compare them both at the same level once both are evolved ( assuming ivs and evs are the same ) . in case you were wondering , the move reminder can help if you are in a bit of a ' catch-22' situation . say you want to wait until eevee learns double edge ( 37 ) , but also want to evolve earlier so that vaporeon learns acid armour ( 29 ) . what do you do ? you wait until eevee learns double edge , and then evolve it . take it to the move reminder , who will be able to teach it acid armour . it does not work in the reverse scenario : one limitation is the move reminder is restricted to the particular moveset associated with the pokémon 's species ( i.e. . current evolutionary form ) . many pokémon , especially those that evolve by way of evolutionary stone , have access to moves that their evolutions do not , such as with eevee , who can learn take down by level though none of its evolutions can . emphasis mine . source
i found this pretty easy to do with a follower , such as lydia . ask her to take something expensive , but light weight ( ie , a ring or necklace ) . then steal it back from her . in my experience , if i failed i did not get a bounty , but your mileage may vary . ( lydia tended to just say something to the effect of " i saw you , but i will let it go . . . this time" ) if you fail , i think you have to wait 2 days before you can steal again , which means that quicksaving/loading is probably faster . you can also level this easily with skill trainers , as money paid to them for skill training ends up in their inventory . pay them to rank up a skill , and then pickpocket the gold back . some skill trainers are also followers ( the companions come to mind immediately ) , so you can do a little of both if you so desire . the only downsides to this is that you can only train 5 times per level , and that it is relatively easy to end up with the trainer carrying too much gold for you to feasibly pickpocket . if they are following you , though , you can always take the money back out of their inventory if you get stuck in this situation . keep in mind that skill gains are based on the value of the item , whereas the difficulty is a combination of weight and value . therefore , light but expensive things provide the best balance of skill gain to risk .
i believe it does not work that way . the title can not pass outside the realm though inheritance . but after you gain the duchy , the title will be outside of the realm , so it can stay there , even if you die .
the answer : pretty firm . the game is playable on the lowest settings , but pretty choppy . not an enjoyable experience , but at least it is doable . the cpu requirements seem to be basically the same -- you can run it on a fast single-core , but not well .
this answer to my similar question may help : . . . followers who start with any kind of bow in their inventory are bugged so that placing a different bow in their inventory will have no effect . it may look as if they equipped the new bow , but the follower will switch back to their default bow as soon as combat starts , even if that bow was removed from their inventory .
you are correct : an xbox cannot have two video signals present at once . the issues is not so much that you are trying to use an hdmi cable + sound but that you could potentially be outputting two video signals . with that being said , there exists a very cheap , very useful adapter i have used with my xbox to accomplish exactly what you are trying to do . i cover it in detail in this question as well as an amazon link to the adapter . you can also ' chop ' off the guard on your existing component cable to make them fit side by side , but make sure you are only running one video question summary buy an xbox adapter that allows audio cables and an hdmi cable to be plugged in at the same time cut your existing xbox component cable 's guard off so they fit side by side , but make sure you are not running two video signals out of it use the fiber optics audio output if you have an audio device that can support it
updated for minecraft 1.6+ the food bar the food bar consists of 10 drumsticks , which are divided into 20 food points , or half-drumsticks . the effects of different hunger levels are detailed here : when the food bar is at 18 points ( 9 drumsticks ) or above , the player 's health will slowly regenerate at a rate of 1 health point every 4 seconds . note that as of version 1.6 , each point healed will cost 3/4 food points ( 3 units of exhaustion ; see detailed explanation below ) if the food bar is at 6 points ( 3 drumsticks ) or below , then the player will not be able to sprint . when the food bar is at 0 , the player 's health will deplete at a rate of 1 ( half a heart ) every 4 seconds ( this makes sleeping impossible ) . on easy difficulty , the player 's health stops dropping at 10 ( 5 hearts ) , on normal it stops at 1 ( half a heart ) , and on hard it keeps draining until either the player eats something or starves to death . hunger mechanics as stated above , the 10 drumsticks above your hotbar represent the 20 food level points in units of half-drumsticks . another aspect of hunger , which is not visible to the player , is food saturation . the player 's food saturation must reach 0 before the player 's hunger will decrease one point . the maximum value of food saturation is equal to the current food level , i.e. if the hunger bar is full ( 20 points ) , the maximum saturation is also 20 . as the player does various activities , saturation points will be consumed over time , and after it reaches 0 , the hunger bar will start to jitter periodically , and begin to decrease . in other words , if the player has just eaten food , whether or not it filled the food bar , they have a certain amount of saturation . for example , if the food bar is at 15 after the player eats , it will not start to jitter and decrease for a period of time , until whatever saturation was gained is depleted . a third aspect of hunger , also not visible to the player , is food exhaustion . this value ranges from 0.0 to 4.0 , with higher values meaning more exhaustion . this is the value that is directly related to the various activities which drain hunger . when exhaustion reaches 4.0 or above , 1.0 saturation point is drained from the saturation level , and the exhaustion level is reset to 0.0 . if this brings saturation below zero , it is set to zero instead . if the saturation level is already at zero , then the player 's hunger level is decreased by 1 point , or half a drumstick . the final aspect of hunger is the foodticktimer . this variable is used for two things . if the player has 0 food points , when the timer reaches 80 , the player is dealt half a heart of damage , indicating starvation . also , if the player has more than 17 food points ( 8.5 drumsticks ) , and the health bar is not full , when the timer reaches 80 , the player is healed half a heart . each time one of these occurs , the timer is reset to 0 and counts up again . activities that increase exhaustion level action and exhaustion level increase walking and sneaking ( per meter ) : 0.01 swimming ( per meter ) : 0.015 breaking a block : 0.025 sprinting ( per meter ) : 0.1 jumping : 0.2 jumping while sprinting : 0.8 attacking an enemy : 0.3 receiving any damage : 0.3 effects of food poisoning ( raw chicken/rotten flesh ) : 0.5 per second ( 15.0 total ) effects of food poisoning ( pufferfish ) : 1.5 per second ( 22.5 total ) regenerating 1 health point : 3.0 the last point is notable ; if the player has low health , they will need to eat often to fully regain their health . this aspect was added in 1.6 . actions not included in this list do not decrease hunger points . standing still , riding in a boat , minecart , or on a horse are some of the things that will not decrease hunger . note : placing blocks does decrease hunger , however this is not documented on the minecraft wiki , so the amount is unknown . adding food and saturation points the different food types nearly all have different values that they each add to the food and saturation levels . since there are many foods , i will just give a few examples here . the full list can be found here . an apple restores 4 food points ( 2 drumsticks ) and 2.4 saturation points . it has an effective quality of 6.4 ( food+saturation ) . a golden/enchanted golden apple also restores 4 food points , but restores 9.6 saturation points ( not to mention the potion effects they give ) for an effective quality of 13.6 . raw beef restores only 3 food points ( 1.5 drumsticks ) and 1.8 saturation points , with an effective quality of 4.8 . steak , however , restores 8 food points ( 4 drumsticks ) and 12.8 saturation points , with an effective quality of 20.8 . this is the most effective food in the game . if two steak are eaten in a row and this fills the hunger bar , the saturation level will also be filled to its maximum possible level of 20 points , 12.8 from the first steak , and the remainder from the second , 20 being possible because the food points will be at 20 .
you want to glide into the wall on the button . batman will activate it , and you can push off and glide elsewhere . you will want to start on top of a building then glide down to it . buttons on walls tend to turn up in sets of three , all of which need to be pressed without touching anything that is not a button . do not be surprised if it turns off when you land .
damage in league of legends is calculated " just in time " . that is , there are no damage calculations performed until the game has confirmed that a unit has taken damage . this has a couple of interesting ramifications . for instance , if you level up a projectile or projectile skill shot while the projectile is in flight , it will do the damage of the new rank , not the rank you had when you triggered it . it also means that teemo 's shrooms only calculate their damage when they trigger , and that all placed shrooms are always at identical power , regardless of when they were placed .
maximizing your chances of a specific item is a complex set of events when an item is generated . there is a good guide here for how items are generated . more info can also be found here . in short for weapons and armors when a monster dies or a chest is opened the item that drops is picked from a treasure class ( tc ) , the tc has to be equal to or less than the monsters level ( mlvl ) . other items ( ring , amulets , jewels , charms and runes ) work a bit different , see the above links for more information on them . once the item has been chosen a check for the quality of the item is done , this is where your magic find ( mf ) helps . set and unique items can have higher item level ( ilvl , some times also refereed to as quality level/qlvl ) than tc , before such an item can drop the mlvl needs to be equal to or higher than the ilvl . if the mlvl is lower than the ilvl of the unique/set item it tried to spawn it will spawn as a rare with triple the amount of durability instead . so if you want to increase your chance of getting an item you need to kill monsters with higher mlvl than the tc of the desired item and with a mlvl higher than the ilvl/qlvl of the desired item . by keeping the max tc of the monster your slay as close to the tc of your desired item , you can exclude unwanted items from even having a chance of dropping and there for increase your chance of getting the item you want . so the questions you need to answer to get the item you want is what is the item level of the item you want , what tc is it in and where do i find monsters that are above them . super uniques are very good for this since they can have predefined tc that can be a lot lower than there mlvl , reducing the number of items they can drop while keeping there mlvl high so they can drop as unique/sets . here and here are some list with mlvl and tc for some of them . a good example for this is cow king on normal , he has tc 12 and mlvl 31 , this means he can drop items up to tc 12 where chain gloves are found and still have high enough level to drop the unique chance guards that are ilvl/qlvl 20 because he is mlvl 31 . usually you would need to kill level 20 monsters to make sure the mlvl was high enough for the unique version of the gloves , but because the super unique monsters tc is lower than his mlvl you can exclude items from tc 15 and 18 even having a chance of dropping , there by increasing your chances of getting chain gloves . here is a list of 1.10 items so you can find the tc and ilvl ( listed as qlvl there ) monster levels regular monsters : mlvl = area level ( alvl ) champions ( all species ) : mlvl = alvl + 2 uniques ( and every minion ) : mlvl = alvl + 3 exceptions normal uses mlvls found in the game files ( monstats . txt ) rather than the area level based values blood raven , griswold , radament , the summoner , izual , nihlathak , the act bosses , and the ubers have predefined mlvls ( here and here are some list with mlvl and tc for some of them ) area levels
you have to master the previous tier in order to be able to crit/use items . since apprentice is the first tier , the game considers the " previous tier " to be " mastered " . if you do not master the apprentice tier and you gain proficiency on the journeyman tier , you will not be able to crit on the journeyman tier or pursue journeymen mastery until you finish apprentice mastery . because of this , if you want to crit on items on any tier other than apprentice , you must complete mastery of every proceeding tier . you can find much more information here .
well , as it turns out , you have to play through the game at least four times . the alternate scenes are : when you are fighting the end , and your final duel with ocelot . the end : beat him normally . beat him by saving , quitting out , and then setting your clock several weeks forward . there is also : letting your stamina drain down . saving , quitting out , and setting your system clock forward a day . ocelot : pick the left gun , shoot ocelot . pick the left gun , miss ocelot . pick the left gun , do not fire . pick the right gun . when you have unlocked all the of the videos in demo theater , you get access to the peep show . which is all the scenes in the game with semi-nudity .
if you place a teemo shroom and then buy deathcap then your shroom will increase in damage automatically . ex : placed shroom will do 150 dmg you buy deathcap placed shroom will now do 250 dmg once the shroom explodes it will not change in damage . ex : placed shroom will do 150 dmg vayne steps on the shroom and it explodes you buy deathcap , zhonyas , void staff , and liandrys all at once the dot damage will not spike to 500 dmg instantly . the shroom will still do 150 dmg .
dyes seem to be found per difficulty level , and are random within the the game as to what colors you find with what merchants each difficulty level will have new dye colors in addition to the dyes from the difficulty levels below it normal : aquatic ( light blue ) , spring ( light green ) , tanner 's ( brown ) , winter ( light grey ) nightmare : cardinal ( red ) , royal ( light purple ) , desert , ranger ( green ) , autumn ( orange ) hell : lovely ( light pink ) , elegant ( dark pink ) , marine ( blue ) , summer inferno : gold , inferno ( red ) , abyssal ( black ) , purity ( white ) , forrester ( green ) edit the only exception seems to be the act i dye merchant in new tristan . he does not seem to live by the same rules than the other dye merchants do , although i have not quite figured out what his rules are . normal : green , brown , and light grey only nightmare : was not paying attention hell : only had normal + nightmare colors until either act ii , or a specific point in act i . i can not remember which , but do remember being disappointed that he did not have new colors , and know i spent quite a bit of time in act i and checked his colors many times inferno : had two new colors the first time i saw him , so perhaps i just had bad luck in hell ?
based on my knowledge there is no app and nothing like this has been announced yet . i guess blizzard will check the success of d3 over the next month until they release such an application .
apartments also allow you to define a spawn location for when you start a new session .
focus fire is critical for sniping injured units and for taking down important or high dps units like void rays , ghosts , brood lords , immortals etc . . . but beyond that , it actually worse to focus fire units . using this awesome map , i have actually tested micro battles with and without focus fire . i have found that 9/10 times any group of units i micro to focus fire just flat out lose to non-micro'd units . there are two problems with naive use of focus fire . 1 ) targeting one unit will most likely cause you to over-kill the unit , which is a waste when you could be shooting at another target . and 2 ) if your unit is not in perfect range of the target , the unit will bumble around until they are , which means instead of attacking , they are bumbling around .
the seed is just a number in the server . properties file . you can see the seed value of the world in the client now , and when you set up a permanent server , add it into there so you dont get the cliffs of mojang when generating new chunks .
according to the various sources i have found , there is only one ending in rochard . there has been a somewhat mixed reaction to it and quite a few people have commented they are also left with questions unanswered . quoted from critical hit : . . . it’s like the writers give up and decide to just quit mid-sentence . at first i wondered if maybe the abruptness of it was related to my play time , and i’d have to do a speed run to get the complete ending , but this appears to not be the case . there’s a difference between a satisfying cliffhanger ending and an ending that comes across as incomplete . . . source | source | source
i have already answered this in my answer to do roads really cost gold to maintain ? . i really believe we can not answer that question without answering this one , making this one a duplicate , but as long as this one is open , i will help . short version : roads you build in neutral territory cost just as much as road in your territory . how much that is seems to vary by difficulty , see do roads really cost gold to maintain ? for the full chart . roads in another nation 's territory cost you nothing . this is the working theory , in need of further testing when i get the chance . again , see the other question for faster updates , although i will come back here and edit once we have full information . finally , as mpenrow already said , you can get the effects of luxury resources throughout your empire without trade routes , so that is not a concern . and remember the hex with the luxury resource itself does not need a road . roads are really only for moving units and connecting cities for trade in civilization 5 .
pressing the jump button allowed me to escape the bubble when i played .
as you guessed , the way to get them is to use the chicken . http://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d/zora%27s_domain river heart pieces there are two heart pieces to grab while en route to zora 's domain . they are attainable only with the help of the lone cucco near the magic bean . grab the cucco and jump to the other side of the river . walk until you hit a wall , then make a short jump across the water to the left . keep going higher by jumping across the small gap to the left . take a right after the gap and keep walking . you will see the heart piece sitting on a platform off to the right . use the cucoo to flutter you over to the high platform in front of you , but when you are about to hit the ledge , toss the cucoo in order to make link grab onto the ledge and pull himself up . then make a daring leap toward the heart piece and link will just barely latch on to the edge . hoist him up to obtain this heart piece . retrieve your cucco friend . if you can not find him , exit and re-enter the area ; he will return to his original location . with chicken in hand , work your way up along the river , watching out for octoroks . when you get to the large waterfall , walk up as high as you can and look around . you should spot a heart piece on a ledge protruding from a wall . jump and hover to it to receive another heart piece .
yes , it is possible to view the item after it has sold . all you have to do is : 1 . press enter to bring up the chat window ( does not matter who you send the message to ) 2 . shift+click on the stack of gold . click on the item in the chat window and you can view the generic stats of the item that just sold . very similar to this question : is there any way to check a recently sold item&#39 ; s stats ? *note : you must view the item before sending the gold to the stash for this to work .
this is obviously subjective , but from my experience : medium - low bronze ( i could beat this when i started , and i placed in bronze ) hard - high bronze ( i could beat this regularly before i was placed out of bronze , possibly low silver ? ) very hard - high silver ? ( i can beat this regularly , and i am ranked now mid-gold ) .
in both cases , so long as your two gyarados have identical natures and iv , the same ev spread will give them identical stats at l100 , no matter when they changed their ev spreads . in fact , you can change your ev spread at l100 through super training and you will still end up with identical stats .
in " offline practice mode " ( where you play against bots ) : statistics ( e . g . longest life ) are turned off achievements cannot be received item drops are possible source : official tf2 wiki , and also verified by personal experience .
serana is capable of wearing both light and heavy armor , but the armor must be an upgrade over her default gear for her to equip it . from her appearance , i would guess that she is already equipped with the female version of the royal vampire armor . she will also equip enchanted rings , amulets , circlets , and some weapons .
uesp 's quest timing page explains which quests are safe to do at any time and which are best avoided until particular circumstances are met . mainly you should avoid doing the civil war quests , as they will preclude many opportunities and can be very buggy .
if you are consistently playing with a barbarian who is buffing your resistances , in addition to being your meat shield , then your gearing strategy should be similar to pre-patch with more focus on damage output ( your health and resists are reasonable and more than sufficient to kill up to azmodan and beyond , depending on your skill level ) . your focus on damage output should not totally neglect increased attack speed as it is still a good stat , but it should not focus on it as your primary stat . remember that the mechanic itself was not nerfed , only the value of ias on items . stacking intellect is always good as it has additional effects ( gaining more resists ) . a balanced combination of critical hit chance and critical hit damage % will give you a noticeable increase to dps as well . the largest single factor in damage output for casters/ranged in general is still the damage range on weapons . you say that your damage is 21k while buffed - are you using both force weapon and familiar , or is this value with just one of them ? 21k damage after being buffed by either of these abilities is low - aim for at least 25k+ unbuffed to have an easier time of killing enemies .
yes there is a way to reset the skill tree by finding the operator in chapter 3 , this is the only opportunity in the entire game to do so and requires specific actions from the previous chapters to set up . it is impossible to max all the skill trees since the maximum level is 35 . the training tree is not too important but it does offer 2 mutagen slots . as for the most rewarding skills , that depends entirely on your play style . you can go full swordsmanship , full signs , or full alchemy , or a mix of the three .
calling players by starting with @ ( for example , @a ) will not work with bukkit . this is not just the /effect command .
no . hallow can not take over jungle . the corruption does take your jungle over , so be aware of underground corruption slowly eating your jungle .
doors of that type may be cut apart by any angelic weapon . the game will make it obvious once you have a weapon of that type and will instruct you to take one of these doors down using it . beyond that sort of door may lie any of the various collectable that the game offers , such as lost souls or keys , though they may also be placed upon the main path through the level .
i am drawing a lot of this from diablowiki and a fantastic compilation thread ; the rest from personal experience . a quick study adria 's journal : leah will drop this after you fight captain dalton in adria 's cellar . lachdanan 's scroll ( all parts ) : these drop from scribe 's lecterns found throughout the cathedral . leah 's journal ( all parts ) : all pages can be found in leah 's room on her desk . new pages are activated as you progress through the quests . leoric 's journal ( all parts ) : these can be found on pedestals in the royal crypts , leoric 's manor , or the hall 's of agony . farmer 's journal : in a satchel that spawns on the north end of the fields of misery ( up a short flight of stairs - shares a spawn with tinker 's hovel and pillaged home ) . scabbard of talic the defender : spawns when doing the event on level 2 of the watch tower ( northern highlands ) - look for vendel the armorsmith . deckard cain 's journal ( all parts ) : found in deckard 's home on his desk ; the second part shows up after you start sword of the stranger . adenah 's jottings : found in the house of curios ( fields of misery ) near the bed . hermit is ravings : drops in a satchel that spawns somewhere in the caverns of araneae . a prisoner 's journal : drops after you free merhan in a random event found at the very end of the halls of agony ( the large area just below the door to the highlands ) . queen asylla 's journal : in her cell , as you enter the cursed hold . scoundrel 's journal : in a satchel in the fields of misery near the trail to the old mill . kingsport bill : drops when you talk to the scoundrel about his origins . skeleton king : drops when you kill him . wandering tinker 's diary : inside the tinker 's hovel in the fields of misery . notes of urik the seer ( all parts ) : satchels found inside the cave of the moon clan . priest 's contemplations : a satchel along the lower fork at the start of wortham . both parts drop from the same spot , so you need to do the quest twice ( or leave your game and resume ) . mira 's letter to haedrig : drops in a box near haedrig 's smithy . the remaining books are all found in an old keepsake box that spawns along old tristram road or in the old ruins . you will need to come back several times to get all the books : cain 's old journal ( all parts ) gillian 's diary ( all parts ) lost journal old diary despina 's journal taking notes report from wortham : on a corpse in the courtyard that connects the northern highlands to leoric 's hunting grounds . command from cultist grand inquisitor : on a musty lectern in the halls of agony . reply from cultist grand inquisitor : same as the command ; you will probably need to come back to find the reply . a page from lazarus 's grimoire : at the bottom of the halls of agony level 3 , watch the cutscene about queen asylla . orders from maghda : drops from the horde of mobs just inside leoric 's manor . villager 's journal : in the keepsake box in the ruins of old tristram ( patch 1.0.3 ) . a summoner 's journal : in the southern highlands , to the right of the map , there will be a small set of stairs to a cultist chanting . ( random spawn ) historian of tristram the hanging tree : drops after you trigger an event at a tree w/ people being hung ( random spawn in the weeping hollow , and random chance to get the event , even if you find the tree ) . a horde of skeletons will spawn after breaking the coffin if you have the correct spawn . gravedigger 's log : on a skeleton in the cemetery of the forsaken . tristram fields : in the fields of misery , near the entrance . khazra heads wanted : in the northern or southern highlands , on a corpse . researching the khazra : in the northern or southern highlands , on a corpse . the khazra massacre : in the northern or southern highlands , on a corpse . the highlands : in the southern highlands ( in a lost chest ) torn letter : in the caverns of araneae in a satchel . torn letter 's response : in the caverns of araneae in a satchel . new tristram : on the table just inside the the slaughtered calf inn . traveler 's journal : off of an adventurer 's corpse along old tristram road warriv 's journal : off of warriv 's corpse along old tristram road tomb robber 's journal : on a corpse just inside the crypt of the ancients ( in the festering woods ) the last stand of the ancients : in the festering woods after completing this event . the drowned temple : on a dead body just inside the temple . warrior 's rest : just inside warrior 's rest in the festering woods . old tristram journal : in an old keepsake box ( same one mentioned for a quick study above )
if you are just looking to do the special takeover quests for delvin mallory that give the thieves ' guild back its old prominence and control in the major holds , then yes , you can do that without completing the main thieves ' guild questline and giving back the skeleton key . you just need to have done five of the delvin/vex quests in that hold ( any hold they give except riften ) , and delvin will mention the special quest when you next return . if you are looking to become the full-fledged guildmaster , then you will need to not only do those special quests , but also complete the main thieves ' guild quests , including giving up the skeleton key .
question like this were asked many times already . here ' s what you are looking for . it is an old list , but it still looks up-to-date . edit looks like there is some encoding problems at that link . here is another one . and it looks easier
evergreen and quake are the only combo , however , this combo can breed a further 17 dragons so there are many failures , one of the worst being the crystal dragon which , using the breeding island , results in a 20 hour breeding time ( or 20 gems to speed up ) . so far i have managed to get 2 amber dragons ( used gems to speed up some failures ) but am now on my 2nd consecutive crystal dragon . just keep trying
you will still be able to roam and play the sub-quests after finishing the main quest .
" execute " is not an official term with a set meaning . generally , it is just used to refer to skills that tend to be situationally good for dealing the final damage to an enemy champion to kill him . garen 's ult is an " execute " because it deals extra damage based on missing hp , and pantheon 's q is an execute because it deals extra damage to low hp targets . the mechanics are not identical , but they both generally lead in the same direction : you can use them to finish off a low-health champion . cho'gath 's ult is also a good execute , because it is best situationally when the enemy will die from the hit , even though it does not get any bonuses at all based on enemy health .
asides from ursa , some of the better heroes for soloing roshan from levels 6-10 are : enigma : using eidolons and a medallion of courage . you may also need a soul ring to keep your mana pool up . the idea here is to cast cast medallion on him to reduce his armor to greatly increase your eidolons ' dps . as madcom mentions below , medallion does not proc roshan 's spell shield so you do not have to worry about him blocking it . nature 's prophet : using treants and a medallion of courage . use sprout in the roshan pit for trees to use . a ring of basilius will help your treants tank roshan more easily . shadow shaman : using mass serpent wards . with careful placement of the wards by the edge of the roshan pit , you can kite roshan with your hero as the wards hit him . venomancer : using plague wards . like with shadow shaman 's wards , kiting roshan is the key . plague wards used to block roshan so you could create a wall between him and venomancer , but that is no longer the case . lycan : using his wolves and a vladimir 's offering . shift aggro appropriately to tank damage . lone druid : using his bear and a vladimir 's offering . shift aggro appropriately to tank damage . troll warlord : with points into fervor and battle trance and either vladimir 's offering or a helm of the dominator . it is also recommended you switch into melee form for faster attack speed , health , and damage ( also , vladimir 's offering would not work if you were in ranged form anyways ) .
there is no way to cancel a mission . either you keep that mission incomplete until the end of the current game , or you complete it . think of it this way : some missions give up-front rewards . the europeans , for instance , may request that you ship a bunch of lumber , and give you the plans for the lumber mill up front . for edicts that have an effect over time , you can issue the edict and then cancel it . this will undo the faction respect you gain from completing the mission , but at least the mission will be off of your plate . for edicts that have a one-shot effect , you are stuck with the result .
yes , you can gamble without access to sanctuary . without considering dlc , there is one vending machine inside the abandoned gas station in the old dahlwell oasis ( the dust ) and one in the holy spirits bar in overlook . see this answer for information on additional vending machines available in dlc locations . as aprough mentions in his comment , with some luck you may find a one-armed bandit to suit your gambling needs . if you find one , make sure to leash them near a vending machine before killing them . otherwise selling unwanted items to continue gambling can be a real pain .
if you take a look at this answer , you will see the break even points for gold . i am not considering dust or cards as part of breaking even since its hard to value those : you have the possibility of breaking even ( 100g for a booster + 50g back ) after just 1 win . you will always break even after 5+ wins ( though at 4 wins its very close to break even as well ) . after 7 wins , you will be playing the arena for free as you will get your entire gold entry fee back .
there are two different types of pets : class pets and companion pets . the former you only get if you are a certain class : warlocks get demonic minions , hunters can train animals to be pets , death knights can get undead pets , and frost mages can get a water elemental as a pet . but i have a feeling you are talking about so-called companion pets . companion pets are rewards for all sorts of things : achievements , quests , out-of-game events ; some are even available for purchase with real money . the best way to find out how to get one is to figure out the companion you had like to have first , and find out what you need to do to get it . to that end , the website warcraftpets . com has a searchable database that gives all the details about the different companion pets .
there are many good reasons to have a jungler in your team : the player that stay solo ( top usually ) while he is lane partner jungle get more gold and experience . the jungler can do or help doing some kills by ganking mid ( 2vs1 ) or bottom ( 3vs2 ) in any moment . some champions are more efficient in jungling than last-hitting in lane ( e . g . amumu , rammus , malphite ) best junglers can also take the dragon ( 190 gold to all team members ) early
i recently picked up the game after i played the first one a few years ago . you can " unsummon " a summoned creature by using the summon teleporter spell . in a few seconds time you are back and forth , so that is better than waiting till the timer runs out . just be sure that you do not have the old creature on autocast : )
yes , there is an end . 30000 meters and a wall zaps you , and that is the end .
i could not find a definitive answer for how many points you can spend on your stats at max-lvl , but according to a post in the official ro2 forum , the highest you can get a stat is 51 . it is explained , that unlike the original ro , your stats will not matter much , since they will be largely overshadowed by your gear . for example : at 50 strength , you will have 100 atk . your gear will add 2-5k ( thousand ) atk , depending on your class . also worth noting : - there is no need to skill both str and int , except if you are a monk or swordsman class . - wis is considered to be useless , regardless of your class . - with no dex , archer classes now need to skill str in order to gain atk here are a few commonly-accepted stat builds that apply to all classes ( according to the forum ) : 50/26/2 26/50/2 40/40/0 39/39/7 3x/3x/3x with the first number referring to either str or int , the second number to agi , and the last to vit [ edit ] as for the skill points : you start with 3 already assigned skill points and will earn 1 skill point per lvl-up . with 50 being the current level cap ; this means you will be able to spend 49 skill points upon reaching the maximum level , totalling 52 skill points . according to some class skill builds available online , it appears that you no longer need to spend all skill points prior to changing class at level 25 . this means , that you can theoretically spend more than 25 skill points for second-class skills . unfortunately , i cannot confirm this personally , since i have not reached level 25 yet . confirmed , thanks to @deruijter .
according to the prima guide , the spawn rate of a golden bee is 1/50 .
as far as i am aware of , no items in the game can increase your projectile travelling speed . however : some skills like arcane orb provide a rune ( obliteration ) that increase the projectile speed . elites with the affixe " missile dampening " can slow them . from the game guide : missile dampening monsters project an aura that slows your incoming projectiles , making ranged attacks less effective .
edit : now i am playing another game and it looks like protecting trade in a node requires either an active merchant or a province in that node ( province of a colony is not enough ) . original answer : i continued playing and now i can send my trading fleets to those trade nodes . it seems the issue fixed itself .
alrighty , in order : why do not i see more stones deposited in my stockpiles ? most of the " stones " you mention having mined are , in fact , raw gems . the others should show up in your stone stockpile , if you have enough room . ( if it is not on this list , it is a stone ) . which of the stones that i have struck so far are useful for crafting picks , weapons , and armor ? which stones should i prioritize finding to craft the aforementioned picks , weapons , and armor ? tetrahedrite is the only one , as it is an ore of copper , which is ( the weakest ) weapons-grade material . what should i do with the other stones that i find ? " common stone " is all of equivalent value . you may be able to make some interestingly colored furniture out of , say , your kimberlite , but color is the only difference , which is moot from a gameplay standpoint . so , do with it whatever you do with the rest of your non-announced stone ! the gems , however , can be used in your gem industry . what is the easiest way to transport , store , and keep track of all my stones and metals ? unfortunately , there really is not . every stone must be moved manually , and if you have a lot of stone ( and few idle dwarves ) , this might take a very long time . consider a quantum stockpile if you are desperate .
your badass rank is a universal stat that applies to all of your characters , and all of your characters contribute to your rank . you get badass ranks from completing the challenges outlined in the badass menu ( default j on pc ) . you can see these challenges in a list on the right-hand side . some challenges are tiered , and reward you with more and more badass ranks and customization items as you advance up in tiers . some challenges are one-off and provide a one-time reward . you can complete a challenge once with each character , which effectively allows you to endlessly increase your badass rank as you create more characters . you can also track challenges by clicking on them in the list . you get more badass tokens as you accumulate badass ranks . the current rate is unknown , but is estimated to be : badass rank = ( badass tokens ) 9 / 5 rounded down to the nearest whole number ( source ) . badass tokens can be spent on a set of 5 random upgrades . each upgrade can be purchased multiple times to no maximum , but there are diminishing returns . for any one upgrade that you invest in , the total accumulated magnitude of that upgrade is given by : magnitude = ( badass tokens spent on option ) 3 / 4 this means that if you invest 20 badass tokens to +% gun damage , you will have ~9.5% bonus gun damage on all of your characters ( source ) . customization items are unlockables you can use to customize your character head and body skins/colors . on request : here are the steps to calculate how many badass ranks you need for your next badass token : calculate your current expected badass tokens from your badass rank . calculate the expected badass rank for an additional token . determine the difference between the expected rank and your current rank . expected badass tokens = ( current badass rank ) 5 / 9 expected badass rank = floor ( ceil ( expected badass tokens ) 9 / 5 ) ranks needed = expected badass rank - current badass rank for example , if you are at badass rank 1000 , you have an expected 46.41 badass tokens ( meaning you have 46 available ) . for one more token ( 47 ) , you would need about 1022 badass ranks , meaning you will need about 22 more badass ranks before you get another token .
you will want to look at the best spirit generator , and the best spirit spender , since you are concerned with overall dps . spirit spenders will give you more damage per attack , but you need spirit to use them , so you need some sort of rotation . high-damage spirit generators : fists of thunder ( bounding light ) does 110% damage + 73% damage every 3rd hit deadly reach ( scattered blows ) does 110% damage + 170% damage every 3rd hit deadly reach ( foresight ) does 110% damage , but increases all your damage by 18% crippling wave ( mangle ) does 143% damage , and has some nice debuffs crippling wave ( breaking wave ) does 110% damage , has nice debuffs , and makes targets take 10% more damage from everyone way of the hundred fists ( blazing fists ) does 140% damage , and increases attack speed by 15% way of the hundred fists ( fists of fury ) does 140% damage , + 10% damage per second ongoing way of the hundred fists ( windforce flurry ) does 140% damage , + 250% damage every 3rd hit way of the hundred fists ( hands of lightning ) does 140% damage , + 28% damage every 2nd hit of 3 high-damage spirit spenders : for these , i would refer you to the question on what monk skill deals the most damage per spirit ? , because you will want to get the most damage out of your spirit buildup . in general , lashing tail kick ( one of the first skills you get ! ) is an extremely effective and efficiency spirit-spending move . all of the above can be used as a reference , but the true highest dps build will depend on your gear and the boss monster you are fighting . some of these skills affect areas or cones , and some involve movement , so the best skill will vary . enjoy trying them all out !
no its not . the only time rebel advancement is bigger is if a rebel scout manages to escape and ' warn ' the fleet . you can always see the exact amount the rebels will advance simply by looking at the shaded section on the sector map and this does not change no matter where your next destination is , even if its across the entire sector ( assuming you have the sub system that lets you jump to any previously visited node ) .
this was easy enough to test . i equipped a weak hunting bow ( i am an archer so i would probably 1 shot any normal npc with my usual bow ) , and found the nearest npc that had no helmet on ( just on the off chance that helmets can prevent head shots for some reason . ) i used getav health to read the npc 's health for every shot . bullseye ! she took 79 damage regardless where i hit her , so no , there is no extra damage for headshots . my tested locations : nose hand feet stomach
if you sacrifice yourself , the marcus shrine will yield a random rare weapon and some money . it is easiest to do this in co-op , although you can do it in single player if you manage to lure a bandit into the hole . note however that you can only do this one time per level - even if you accidentally close the pit when no one is inside of it , you do not get a chance to redo the sacrifice and will have to exit and re-enter the area .
caving is the way to go there is no specific way to find an abandoned mineshaft . caves and ravines are probably your best bet , because you can see and cover large distances underground in these . even so , finding one may take quite a lot of exploring . using x-ray bugnology if you do not want to go exploring so much , you can try using an x-ray machine to see underground , but this is technically using bugs . a simple x-ray machine consists of two regular fenceposts and two redstone blocks . dig a 2x1x3 , stand in it and close the top with dirt . place the fenceposts on top of each other , and walk up to them . then place the redstone blocks against the fenceposts , starting at the bottom . you are now in the redstone blocks , whose textures are not rendered from inside , and you can see underground as far as the next cave in all directions . mineshafts naturally spawn some torches , so you can identify them easily . icky spiders avoiding cave spiders is no problem when you have not found a mineshaft yet , since they only spawn from spawners there . in a mineshaft , there is a high chance to encounter one of these , but if you want to avoid them , look out for large amounts of cobweb . the spawners are typically surrounded by around 5-15 blocks of cobweb in all directions , which makes them easy to spot , and turn another way . i suggest taking them on though . with decent weapons and armor ( iron usually suffices ) , they are not to hard . try to take cover behind the fenceposts and cut your way through the cobwebs with a sword ( or shears ) . drinking a bucket of milk will neutralize the poison .
the improved crafting perk reduces the cost of adding mods to your weapons and , when aced , the cost of customizing your mask . you do not actually craft weapons in payday 2 . mods available for purchase can be viewed by double-clicking the weapon you want to mod within your inventory .
updated : i was not really satisfied that my previous answer was correct , so i spent some time experimenting . i was partly right and partly wrong . experiment 1: i traversed the 1st island with the screen pressed nonstop . it took approximately 60 seconds for the day/night division line to move from 90° ( vertical ) to approximately 20° . i traversed the 2nd island with the screen pressed nonstop . it took approximately 35-40 seconds for the day/night division line to move from 90° ( vertical ) to approximately 20° . i traversed the 3rd island with the screen pressed nonstop . it took approximately 30 seconds for the day/night division line to move from 90° ( vertical ) to approximately 20° . conclusion : the sun goes down progressively faster on each island . experiment 2: i performed experiment 1 with a nest multiplier of x0 and x23 . results were extremely similar . conclusion : nest level does not appear to affect the speed of the sun . experiment 3: i went off the island 1 to island 2 jump at minimum speed . the sun went backward approximately 70° . i went off the island 2 to island 3 jump at minimum speed . the sun went backward approximately 35° . conclusion : end of island jumps push back the sun , regardless of speed . these boosts diminish on each consecutive island ( and appear to be gone completely by the 3rd or 4th jump . ) experiment 4: i traversed nearly all of island 1 in fever mode . the sun moved backward approximately 10-20° . tried slides , cloud touches and coin collecting . none of these activities , individually , appeared to have any effect on the sun . i deleted and reinstalled the game for experiment 2 , and i noticed that i was able to get to mid-island 7 pretty consistently , regardless of my much lower nest multiplier ( and total score ) . so it appears that speed , not points , cause the sun to roll back or slow down . conclusion : going fast can push back the sun . slides and cloud touches do not seem to have a major effect on the sun , although these are tied up with speed . this speed effect may also diminish on later islands , or it may simply be countered by the sun setting faster . bonus conclusion : there is a limit to how far the sun can be rolled back , about 90° backward from the starting position ( with the sun just beyond the left edge of the screen ) .
the other remaining option for you to get the power armor training is to do the for auld lang syne quest given to you by arcade gannon . he is one of the possible followers and you can find him in the old mormon fort . to trigger the quest , you will have to gain his trust or progress far enough or you can follow the quest line for the independent vegas ( yes man 's quests ) you can trigger it without gaining his trust .
i believe you are referring to the permission nodes that are integrated into bukkit already , such as /say , /plugin , /help , /stop , etc . you can find them all on the bukkit wiki , in a nice , organized table .
yes , it is entirely possible , just as it has been in earlier animal crossing games . there is a difference in how to obtain the tools of different levels , but you do not have to obtain them in any certain order .
no , all the side quests can be completed after you beat the main mission . in fact , skipping side quests is a good strategy on playthrough 2 as the quest rewards in playthrough 2.5 will be boosted to the max level of 50 , so you can get good rewards such as a level 50 teapot . you just have to make sure you do not accept the quest until you reach playthrough 2.5 .
your bank in guild wars 2 is bifurcated - you have the guild bank , where you can put whatever you want ( and buy storage expansions for ) and you have the collections tab , which holds the most common crafting materials . pressing " deposit all collectibles " will check to see if there is room in your collections tab ( stack size is 250 ) , and if it is , it will automagically be sent there . this is one way , however - you can not " un-deposit collectibles" ; you will have to actually make it to a bank or crafting station for that ! one thing to be aware of is that miniatures count as collectibiles , so if you have , say , a miniature rytlock brimstone from the digital deluxe edition , pressing " deposit all collectibles " will store your pet in the collections tab as well as that copper ore you mined .
xpadder you have stated you are interested in xpadder , which i highly recommend . i have used it and it works wonderfully ; it has a great user interface and makes setting up a controller a breeze . easy configuration the ability to import a picture of your controller and configure each button in the right place on-screen makes it really , really easy to configure . you can see exactly what you are doing . no configuration usually , though , you will not have to configure anything , unless you have a really , really obscure controller and/or really , really obscure game . you can simply google e.g. " xpadder mass effect " or " xpadder bioshock 2" or " xpadder 360 controller " to find controller images , controller config files , and game config files already carefully created by somebody else to work with your controller and the default key/mouse settings for your game . powerful there are a huge amount of useful options for what each button can do , including all possible key combinations and sequences , mouse movements , etc free version if you want to try xpadder before buying it , you are in luck . there exists an older version ( v5.3 ) that the author has stated will remain free because it was the last release that supported windows 2000 . ( source ) however , it is over two years old ( came out in 2008 i believe ) , so it will not have any of the bug fixes or some controller support that xpadder has gotten over the last couple of years . you can download it here .
to enter hardmode you need to kill the wall of flesh ( commonly refereed to as wof ) not the eater of worlds . the wof is summon-able by dropping a guide voodoo doll into lava ( this will also kill your guide , but a new one will spawn in after a bit ) . the dolls are often carried by voodoo demon 's , be careful this will be the hardest boss you have fought so far , by a long way . i would suggest reading some strategies before attempting it . for some more detail check out the wiki
yes , this is very similar from prestiging . the only benefit is the an increase in xp gained , effectively making it easier the further you are . from ign , regeneration is a level 50 feature in titanfall that allows you to become a " next generation pilot . " this will reset all your challenges , unlocks , and revert your rank to level 1 . in return , you will gain experience at an accelerated rate during the next generation and display a special chip next to your gamertag . you will also keep all burn cards and unlocked titans . to regenerate , you must first reach level 50 . you will then be able to select the " regenerate " option at the bottom of the menu . counting the starting 50 levels , there are a total of ten generations in titanfall . all players start out at generation one and can regenerate up to nine times . at later generations , you must complete select challenges before you can regenerate . these challenges will become available the instant you unlock the weapon they are tied to .
no , the black market tracks your progress between all playthroughs , and all other upgrades ( ie , additional weapon slots ) are unmissable/plot related . if you pass up on these side quests , you may miss out on achievements , some ( probably pretty poor ) loot , and other quest rewards like eridium , xp , or cash . however , you will not miss out on anything permanently , nor anything essential . do note that starting playthrough 2 means you will not have access to sanctuary until you advance the plot to that point ( probably an hour or two of play ) . however , at any point you can return to your first playthrough to return to sanctuary and/or complete any of these quests you may have passed up on .
when a portal is accepted , you receive a mail saying you will see it in a near future . but after that , no other notifications , you will have to check your scanner when you are near a future portal location or look on the intel map every day ; - ) edit : new portals were added today ( 25/01/2013 ) and nothing inform us ( except seeing many people running everywhere with their phone in hands to capture new portals before the other faction ; ) ) .
this line is indeed based on the decision you have made during the wol campaign . for me it is been the exact opposite . she talked to jim about how he helped her ( i did the nova missions back then ) . i think the actual scene playing is still the same ( just changed text/voiceover ) . i think ( although i am not 100% sure ) it picks the line based on your last campaign playthrough you did before ( re- ) starting the hots campaign .
a quick google search will find you this site : leviathan dragon . to breed the leviathan dragon , you will have to use a sea hybrid and a war hybrid to get it . below are some combinations that will give you a shot at this rare hybrid . colossal ( war+terra ) + mercury ( sea+metal ) nenufar ( sea+nature ) + juggernaut ( war+flame ) red woods ( war+nature ) +plankton ( terra+sea ) red woods ( war+nature ) + waterfall ( sea+terra ) if you would like to see the full breeding chart , click here .
yes they do exist . there are some tell-tale signs as you can go into the replay and see what your opponent was looking at the given time . due to this some signs are : if you notice them staring at your base for long period of times when they do not have vision . they jump to the location of your army moving out , once again without having vision . they view the location just as you start expanding , once again without having vision . best way to see if someone is doing it is just view the replay and put on their vision . it is usually very obvious if they are using a program to remove the fog of war .
when played cooperatively items drop separately for each player . this means each player sees their own loot and not loot that has dropped for the other people in the group . when picked up and dropped on the ground or traded the items obviously become visible to the other players as well . when playing in a group , the total magic find of the group will be divided equally amongst each player . here is an example given by blizzard : the group consists of four players . in total , their stats are 50% mf , +20% gf and 10% xp , each of these players will have a 12.5% ​​mf , 5% gf and 2.5% xp being in such a group . who deals the killing blow does not matter .
curse cannot install minecraft mods . what it can do is manage texture packs and saved worlds , as well as giving you the ability to try out the snapshot builds that are released periodically . this snapshots are installed separately from your regular installation . if you do not want to have to go through complex configuration ( you often need to unpackage and repackage the files to install mods ) , then you can use skydaz to get one-click mods installers . hopefully , those work for you . alternatively , we have already have a question that covers manually installing mods for minecraft 1.6.1 onwards .
most likely you need to take the time to properly align the portals in both worlds . it takes some effort , but if you exactly align your portals everything seems to work correctly on the smp server i regularly play on . from the minecraft wiki . to setup pairs of portals properly so that they reliably travel to each other , it is best to build both portals manually . build at desired location x , y , z in the normal world . then travel to the nether world . and then dig your way to x/8 , y , z/8 , and build a portal there .
you can breed any two hybrid dragons that collectively have all four elements fire , earth , water and air . example breeding pairs are mud + blaze or lava + fog . in fact those are the only breeding pairs not counting rares . note the dragon is rare and will take several tries ; you might want to use the epic breeding island . panlong dragons have a unique breeding/egg time of 36 hours so you will know when you got one right away ; they also have a unique egg . panlong dragons will be available for the entire of the year of the dragon ( 2012 ) . if you have at least two you will be able to breed panlong dragons together to get panlongs even after the event is over .
the other answers are pretty good , but just to add a couple more points . work on filling out your pokedex go back to different areas and catch pokemon you are missing ( check the pokedex for their locations ) . trade between x and y to get the ones you can not catch in your game evolve pokemon you have caught already i usually set up a pokemon geared toward catching other pokemon . smeargle works well for this - teach it false swipe , mean look , a paralysing move such as stun spore , and something else ( i usually run with a move to hit ghost pokemon ) try your hand at multiplayer : link battles tend to be a lot different to singleplayer battles - they have their own tactics , and the battles tend to be harder as they are more evenly matched ( where singleplayer is geared towards you winning ) . you really have to focus on team cohesion a lot more . check out smogon for different tactics , and check which pokemon work well ( and work well together ) . it is still geared toward gen 5 , as the community is still learning the ins and outs of x/y , but most of the info there will stay relevant . there is a big focus on having pokemon with the right individual values ( ivs ) , effort values ( evs ) and natures . you can be average in multiplayer without worrying too much about these , but if you plan on entering tournaments this is where you will gain the edge over your opponents . trade for all the vivillion variations : there are 18 different wing patterns , depending on which real-world geographic area you hail from . see if you can trade for all types . most people on gts will trade scatterbug for scatterbug , so this would be my first point of call . once you start looking for the harder to get ones , i would check out some of the forums/reddit posts for people wanting to trade duplicates .
you unlock new weapons and gear for your loadouts simply by playing and earning xp and gaining levels . weapon attachments for a particular weapon are unlocked by using that weapon and increasing its level . weapon mods are unlocked by using the decoder on the various storage items you earn from missions . they also often give you xp which will help with unlocking new gear faster . you can unlock a second decoder for decoding multiple items at a time on the far cry outpost website and the mobile app ( in which you can play a puzzle minio-game to earn up to 5 decodable items per day . as said above , you can only choose , not create/edit a loadout before or in between missions .
according to blizzard 's article on the infernal machine : to craft the infernal machine , players will first need to collect four components from powerful keywardens in each act of inferno : the key of destruction will drop from odeg the keywarden in act i - fields of misery the key of hate will drop from sokahr the keywarden in act ii - dahlgur oasis the key of terror will drop from xah'rith the keywarden in act iii - stonefort the blacksmithing plans will drop from nekarat the keywarden in act iv - silver spire level 1 note that these only drop in torment . the higher the level of torment , the better the chance of getting one , up to 50% at torment 6 . the plans are taught to your blacksmith , and only are needed once . after that , you just need the keys from the previous three acts , as using the infernal machine consumes it .
the entire process is detailed pretty well on the official blog . the basic steps are in each act , get 5 stacks of nephalem valor and then fight the keywarden for a chance to collect the keys/plan . ( you only need to get the plan once ) give the blacksmith 12,000 gold to construct the portal device . use the portal device in heretic 's abode to reach one of the uber bosses and get a chance to collect an organ . purchase a recipe for the ring from squirt for 2 million gold ( only need to do this once ) give all 3 organs to shen along with 15,000 gold to construct a ring . so its a minimum of 51,000 gold per ring ( 3 x 12000 + 15000 ) , plus a one time cost of 2 million for the ring recipe .
there really is not a way to install steam to a custom directory , as it always wants to install in the default program files location -- usually c:\program files\ or c:\program files ( x86 ) . however , you can use the windows " mklink " utility to create a file system pointer from the default location to wherever you want to store the files . typically i do this with my game data files ( everything under "\steam\steamapps\common " within the program files folder ) , since these are the files that take up the most space . also , installing from a dvd is another matter , so i will answer that separately . to install steam data to a custom directory : locate your game data , usually under c:\program files\steam\steamapps\common or c:\program files ( x86 ) \steam\steamapps\common ( if you have 64-bit system ) copy it to the new location delete it from the original location ( make sure you have it copied / backed up first ! ! ) open a command prompt by selecting start and typing : cmd in the command prompt type the following ( include the quotes ) : mklink /j " c:\program files\steam\steamapps\common\game " " c : [ new location ] \game " example : mklink /j " c:\program files\steam\steamapps\common\altitude " " c:\games\altitude " this will create what is called an " ntfs symbolic link " ( sort of like a directory shortcut ) which transparently links steam 's default directory to whatever directory you specify . there is also an app which will do the heavy lifting for you , called " steam mover " . to install a steam game from a dvd instead of downloading it , do the following : log in to steam and click on library . right-click on the game , and select delete local content . insert the dvd and close steam ( steam > exit ) . press windows key + r to open run type : " c:\program files\steam\steam . exe " -install d : ( replace " c:\program files\steam\steam . exe " with your actual steam install location if different ; replace d : with your dvd drive letter if different ) , and click ok . steam will launch and ask you to sign in if you do not have your password saved . your installation should continue from the disc .
i have not tested this , but i found this in nethackwiki : http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/watchman pacifying all hostile shopkeepers by paying them off also pacifies any angry watchmen on the level , so you can pacify all the watchpeople in mine town by stealing something inexpensive ( a gold piece ) from a shop and paying for it when the angry shopkeeper comes after you . usually when i get hallucinated in such places i try not to attack anything , unless it hits me first , because then it is no watchman or pet . coming back later letting your pet kill the watchmen is also an option . as far as i know , every kind of crime is treated the same way .
corruption will convert mud to dirt , but it will not grow corruption grass on any level too deep for regular grass . so the surface jungle will eventually be destroyed completely , but underground jungle and glowing mushroom farms should lose some areas to dirt at the edges , but then shrink no further .
only once per difficulty , after that if you fuse 3 essences ( dropped from the act bosses in hell ) in the cube in act 2 you can get more .
the stars allow you to save highlight reels as your favourites . you may then view these highlights in mario kart tv . your favourites are available in the favorites tab , by pressing r or zr twice after opening mktv . you may remove favourites from that tab by pressing - .
i am inclined to suggest that if the game was not coded in such a way that it will not be possible . given the age of diablo ii and the very recent rise in popularity of boarderless windowed mode i think it is very unlikely .
you can place up to 10 ships in 1 fleet you can put 1 fleet into a trading port for each trading ship ( war ships have no effect here ) in a fleet occupying a trading port , you get a certain amount of money each turn . the amount you get is calculated every turn , so if you remove a trading ship from that fleet , you will earn less money next turn from that trading port if you put at least 1 trading ship on an trading port , a trading route will appear between that trading port and one of your coastal cities . iirc , you can check the amount of money from a trading route simply by hovering your mouse over it . you can see last turn 's total trading route revenue in the balance sheet . the best strategy to maximize revenue from an trading port is to put a fleet of 10 trading ships there and park some escorting warships directly next to it . the zone of control from the warships do not prevent enemies from attacking your trade fleet , but they will join the battle .
monster health does not scale according to the number of players . however , monsters in tanzia port have more health than monsters fought in the moga village . icemannoob did a video to prove this a ways back , as you can see below . he fought a great jaggi in the village ( 19 hits ) , along with a great jaggi in tanzia port solo ( 24 hits ) and in a group of four ( 23 hits ) .
you should be able to use the plants vs . zombies save under the following conditions : go to your saved games view . scroll down to the P section . you should see an entry for plants vs . zombies . open it and see if there is a save game there that you own . if there is a plants vs . zombies saved game , then the downloadable version should recognize the file and load it with no appreciable difference . i have not heard about any differences between versions , but you should probably try looking around the pvz wikia for more info on the file format .

tank = characters that can wade into battle and take vast amounts of damage . they also tend to have a lot of cc ( crowd-control ) abilities , such as stuns , snares , taunts , silences , slows . jungle = characters that roam through both jungles killing minions ( including the large minions that grant red buff and blue buff ) and ganking ( ambushing ) opponents . usually characters with good heal , attack , and speed , etc . carry = they are the high-dps champions . usually squishier and needs to be protected by tanks , etc . but let a carry get away and game over . they do serious ap ( ability power ) or ad ( attack damage ) . support = champion that supports his/her allies . provides good map control , crowd control , and heals . ap = ability power aka magic power . you need high mr ( magic resistance ) to counter ad = attack damage aka physical power . you need high armor to counter dps = damage per second . general benchmark on how much damage you are dishing out . typically the more the merrier ! ats = attack speed - how fast a champion attacks ( example = 1.00 ats = 1 attack per second ) max 2.50 . ms = move speed - how fast a champion moves . good luck and have fun ! lol is awesome . cv = clairvoyance - summoner spell that reveals any area of the map . cs = creep score - the number of creeps a champion has killed . oom = out of mana - the champion saying this has no mana . mia or ss = missing in action - enemy in another lane is missing , so you should be cautious of a gank . re = return - enemy who has been missing in action is back in the lane . b = recall - pressing the b button to teleport back to base after 8 seconds .

the minimum requirements of the witcher 2 for the graphics card are an nvidia gf 8800gt or an equivalent amd graphics card . your radeon hd 5450 is an htpc card , not a graphics card meant for playing games . it has about 1/4 of the performance of the minimum requirement ( see this test in german , compare it with the 9800 gt ) . i am sorry , but you are below the minimum requirements and i do not believe you can get the game to run adequately on your computer without a graphics card change . but everything else in your computer seems fine for the game , so you would only need to put in a new mid-range graphics card .
it is not possible , and for a good reason . several assignments offer a bonus up-front ( like money or free blue prints ) . if you could just take an unlimited number of assignments , you could gather all bonuses without even intending to actually work on them . instead , the game forces you to decide what you actually want to accomplish . it would be great to get 5000$ for exporting 300 cars , but right now you are really struggling just to not have your citizens starve - so do not accept it . or do accept it , intentionally agreeing to be bound to the contract even if it will take a long time to fulfill , and potentially prevents you from accepting other tasks later . in the campaign , 1 or 2 tasks are often fixed and mandatory , though sometimes you can decide when to start them . it may be wise to accept them later , when you are ready . despite all this , the fact that elections and rebel attacks are mandatory , too , is a design choice i would personally consider at least somewhat questionable .

yes . if you meet the requirements - no matter by what methods - you can place jump clones .
i think the best way to imagine it is to imagine your total effectiveness as combination of the two attributes - you call them speed and brain . i think your total effectiveness is best modeled as speed times brain . increasing either one is useful , but increasing only one is not as helpful as increasing both . if you have a 10 for brain but a 1 for speed ( ie you know exactly what your opponent is thinking , but you can barely use a mouse ) , your total score is 10 . if you are as dumb as a pile of bricks ( brain 1 ) but have great mouse skills ( speed 10 ) , you might also have a score of 10 . but a guy with moderate brains and fingers might have a score of 5 times 5 or 25 , which would beat both of the extremely lopsided guys . finally , note that if you watch a lot of vids and up your brain score by 4 points to 9 , you are a 9 times 5 or 45 . if you instead watched some vids and practice some " speed " , you are now 7 times 7 , or 49 . in other words , try to balance out both strategy and execution .
i finally found out the answer through rift support . i needed to reinstall directx . this is counter intuitive , because i have a brand new , up to date , windows 8 and the direct x version is from 2010 or so . in any case , this was their answer : thank you for contacting us regarding rift . i apologize for the difficulty and frustration you have encountered when attempting to play rift . it sounds as if you may be experiencing a direct x issue . please visit the following link as this should correct the issue you are experiencing . http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=41srcfamilyid=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3srcdisplaylang=enu=http%3a%2f%2fdownload.microsoft.com%2fdownload%2f1%2f7%2f1%2f1718ccc4-6315-4d8e-9543-8e28a4e18c4c%2fdxwebsetup.exe if this does not resolve your issue , or if you have any additional questions or concerns , please do not hesitate to let us know . thank you for your continued support of trion worlds and for playing rift . i hope this helps anyone else having the same problem .

this is the new " arms deal " update which went live yesterday ( 14/08/2013 ) . valve released a really good faq on it , which can be found here . the bits of interest for your particular question , " how can i get new guns ? ": timed weapon drops , just by playing on official and community servers in any game mode . opening dropped weapon cases with a weapon case key . trade weapons with other players through steam 's trading interface . purchase them from other players through the steam marketplace . regarding the first point , these are obtained for play time over the course of a week . as your play time increases , the drop rate will slow down . this is reset when the week rolls over . not sure the start day or time of a week though . i am not 100% sure where you will get the weapon case keys . the below quote suggests that you buy these : this update will also actively support the cs:go competitive community with the introduction of the esports weapon case . a portion of the proceeds from sales of esports case keys will go towards prize purses at competitive events . hope that helps .

it signifies that you gain a reward from completing the achievement , meaning you get new designs for your banner . the number is how many rewards are available for that achievement , so for boss achievements where the achievement has a reward for each difficulty you will see a star with 4 next to it .
all babies obtained by breeding take 20 minutes to grow up . there is no way to speed up this process , except for sheep , which can grow faster if they eat grass , and foals or colts ( baby horses ) which you can feed to speed up their growth . you can re-breed animals after 5 minutes .
the quest reward changes with your spec , so you just have to be the spec needed for the desired item when handing in the quest . to show this i made this video : this is also true for dungeon quests that award rare items ( blue )
yes , you can deposit your pokemon in the bank , restart the game , and withdraw them again . you can even insert a different pokemon cartridge and access your banked pokemon on the new cartridge as well . do note that you cannot keep items this way - items will be returned to your backpack upon depositing pokemon in the bank . reference : pokemondb
they do not exist yet , probably have to wait for a future update
my understanding is that the match-making system is based on several things , including , but not limited to : your mmr , server preference , party size , and language . ideally , the system will match you 9 other plays of exactly the same mmr , server preference , party size and language . clearly this is a rare occurence , so the system looks for the best matches , and if it can not find them , it lowers its requirements in terms of the quality of the match , and looks again . you can see the progress of this search in the search-range graphic while you are finding a match - the wider the light-blue bar , the bigger the range in mmr etc the system is willing to accept to match you to a game . thus , the longer you are searching , the wider the range of different players you will get - hence it being preferable to play at peak times for your region , rather than in the morning for example . it is probably worth mentioning that while your mmr is key in the above system , it is been shown that language is given a significant weighting as well - i have heard stories of 5-stacks that will deliberately select , for example , in the hope that they will be matched with low-mmr teams that they can easily beat . as another interesting side note - my understanding of how the match-making works with mmr , is that it will skew the " party mmr " according to each players mmr - but ! ! if you have one player that has higher skill than the rest of your team , it will skew the party mmr more significantly towards his/her mmr , on the basis that they will have a great impact . by example - if you have 4 players with a 2000 mmr , and one with a 3000 mmr , you might expect the party mmr to be 2200 , as an average . the actual figure is taken to be much closer to 3000 ( though i confess i do not know how much by ) , to prevent said 3000 mmr player taking mid , and dominating the match . hope this helps , sorry if i have rambled ! !
you should be able to find the uranium mod by searching for it on the minecraft forums , as well as instructions to install it . the link to the uranium mod thread . this mod requires the mod files itself and an additional mod to work called mod loader . mod loader , and uranium mod both have instructions to install ( for mac ) right in their respective topics . since there is already a question involving how to install mods on macs i will let you combine the info from that and the info in the threads , rather than dupe it here .
it only levels up when you do damage ( source ) . hits do not count .
this is of course a combination of guesswork and snooping so may not be 100% accurate : a redditor downloaded eclipse and compared letters on tabs to match the half letter on each of notch 's tabs . he came up with the following : here is the original image for comparison : which as mark trapp says fits with the minecraft wiki source : reddit
there are 25 weapon levels , from a , a+ , a++ , a+++ , b , . . . to s ( a=1 , a+=2 , a++=3 , etc ) each character 's average weapon level ( awl ) is the average level of weapons in both hand ( e . g shotgun lv3 , melee lv1 --> character awl is 2 ) . awl of team is the average of all character 's awl . the game always seems to round up the calculation . you level up a weapon type by causing damage with it ( destroying parts or wanzers gives more experience ) . so , to keep awl low , you need to : ( a ) avoid grinding with battle simulator . ( b ) avoid using the same team over and over . ( c ) avoid using the same weapon over and over . for example , carry a weapon you have low skill in and use it to finish off enemies . ( d ) distribute the kills carefully among team members .
provided you have the tools to install the game server you want ( programs from the games sites ) and you know what operating system it requires , you can opt for any hosting platform like any other website . be careful on the banswidth you are allocated and the machine specifications . depending on the number of player you intend to host games for , it may require a certain amount of power . you can also have a machine of yours in a datacenter if you have enough money and wish to invest in that .

magicka uses a ' checkpoint and chapter ' save system . the various checkpoints you reach save your progress against death - if you screw up , they are where you will restart from . progress is saved persistently - read , across sessions - after completing each chapter . fortunately , each chapter is fairly short , taking only about an hour , give or take some to complete once you have figured out the various gimmicks , puzzles and dangers .
i just tested this out on my character and can safely say that no , the shield being heavy armor will not remove the bonuses received from custom fit , wind walker , or matching set . those bonuses are applied as long as you have light armor equipped to your head , chest , hands , and feet . so , boots , gloves , helm , and armor . the shield has nothing to do with those perks , so you are good !
no . unfortunately not . your only goal is [ or should be ] to kill him before he enters the portal with his loot .
to play with a person in another region you will first have to create a character on that region .
first off , let me start off by saying that unlike previous games , or even the previous stages of this game itself , it is very unlikely you can win this one solely by using and abusing one aspect of kratos ' repertoire . this trial requires a lot of switching and mastery of most , if not all of kratos ' skills . most importantly , do not forget about your l2 attacks ( amulet of uroboros and stone of orkos ) . they are incredibly useful and probably necessary to defeat this . at this point in the game , you should have completely upgraded your blades , your amulet , and your stone , as well as at least one of the elemental forces . i had everything maxed out at this point , and it helps a lot . if you are so inclined , you should be able to go back to the " chapter select " and farm some red orbs to upgrade if you are behind . first platform enemies 4 gorgons 4 sirens important skills . amulet of uroboros stone of orkos ares/hades specialization if you have upgraded ares , your rage will fill extremely fast , and your attacks will hit extra hard while you have full rage . you can do a quick switch to hades to release your rage as a swarm of souls that will keep attacking everything for a while . while the ares magic is a guaranteed hit on anything in range , i preferred to use hades magic , as it will eventually hit them if they are out of range , since it lasts so long . i also found it has a better chance to ring out the sirens ( knock them off the platform ) . quick tips all attacks can be blocked , except for the gorgon 's stone gaze and siren 's screech . if you parry a gorgon 's attack , you will get a grapple opportunity that will turn other enemies to stone briefly if they are in range . you can knock the sirens off the edge of the platform . square , square , triangle attacks ( at least ares and hades versions ) will interrupt/knock back the gorgons , and if you can manage to hit them with it , the sirens as well . everything on this platform will give you magic orbs if you brutal kill them . tactics this is arguably the hardest platform of all . how you do here will determine how easy the rest will be . as soon as the first gorgon comes up , get some attacks off , then wait for the second one . use your amulet ( if upgraded , it will slow both if they are next to each other ) , then use your stone . make sure you can hit both , then use your magic of choice twice . as soon as you finish , use your amulet ( try to hit both if you can ) , then use your stone again . at this point , at least one , if not both of them , should have a halo for a brutal kill . note that this combo ( amulet/stone -> magic x2 -> amulet/stone ) is incredibly useful . i will refer to this combo as " the combo " moving forward . as soon as you kill one gorgon , another one will show up . focus the other one if it does not have a halo yet . pretty soon after you kill the first one , the sirens will show up . after you kill the second gorgon , a fourth will show up . now you are dealing with two gorgons and two sirens . as soon as you can get it managed , use " the combo . " if you can , try to get in a corner or near the edge , and get the sirens between yourself and the railing . there is a pretty good chance you will ring out a siren or two , which helps a lot . after this combo , something should be ready for a brutal kill . when the first two sirens die , two more will show up . take care of the gorgons first , use your blades and your amulet/stone to clean up . if you are struggling , use another magic ( in " the combo " if you can ) . you will probably be down to two sirens last , just be patient and watch for the screech ( remember everything else can be blocked ) . second platform enemies 2 amazons 6 ? harpies 1 electric golem important skills amulet of uroboros stone of orkos ares/hades specialization quick tips all attacks can be blocked , except for one from the golem . if you parry an amazon , you get a free grapple that gives you rage orbs and does considerable damage to everything . you can grapple and throw the harpies , and can throw them off the edge if you aim correctly . amazons will give you health orbs if you brutal kill them . amazons can be knocked off the edge ( you will not get much health this way ) . tactics you will start off with two amazons and two harpies . start off with your amulet/stone , which should hit everything due to the cramped fighting quarters . get as many hits off as you can here , and watch for blocks ( parries if you are quick enough ) . when the amulet starts to wear off , use your magic of choice , then use your amulet/stone again . you may need to get a few more attacks off before you get a halo , but once you do it gets a lot easier . another viable strategy at this point is to be defensive and wait for parries on the amazons . once both amazons are down , remember you can throw the harpies . try to get them off the edge asap . at this point , fire will start coming out of the walls and move slowly down the gauntlet . you should get a grace period here to familiarize yourself with how to avoid it . before long , the golem will show up with a harpy . get rid of the harpy , which should not be too hard since the golem moves so slowly . use your amulet/stone to whittle the golem down , and keep your distance so that you can easily avoid it and the fire . get hits in when you can , but do not be overzealous . remember the golem is invulnerable when it has the spark lit up inside its chest , and wait for it to wear off before you continue attacking . he should go down pretty quickly . third platform enemies 1 centaur 6 ? wraiths ( and spawned company ) important skills amulet of uroboros stone of orkos ares/hades specialization poseidon specialization ( optional ) zeus specialization ( optional ) quick tips every attack can be blocked , except for one of the centaur 's close range attacks and his charge . the charge can be avoided through a quick time event ( qte ) . the centaur will always charge you if you are too far away ( can be abused for the qte ) . parrying an attack from a wraith gives you a grapple opportunity . wraiths can be knocked off the edge . killing a wraith with a brutal kill or grappling them after a parry will give magic orbs . the spiked walls hurt you if you touch them . tactics let me start off by saying that evading ( rolling ) is a bad idea for this whole platform . not only is there no point , since everything can be blocked , but it is a pretty small area with spiked walls that will damage you and give enemies an opportunity to hit you if you run into them . you will start this one by fighting the centaur alone , which is pretty easy compared to everything you have already done . to make it easier , there are quite a few options . you can abuse his charge for the free qte and use your amulet/stone in between . you can use poseidon magic , which will keep him slowed for a while and make his attacks easy to block . or you can just straight up fight him , which is not very hard . killing him with a brutal kill will give you a large amount of health orbs . lastly , you are going to fight a group of wraiths . these guys will spawn a bunch of phantom wraiths ( different color ) , which can be overwhelming . luckily , these spawns die quickly , allowing you to focus on the real one . i can not remember exactly because once i got here , i only fought them once , but i believe you never fight more than two or three wraiths at a time . start off with " the combo " if you can , which should take care of one of the first two at least . i found the zeus magic to be effective here , since it pulls everything toward you , but i think any magic would work here . note that wraiths can be knocked off the edge , so if you are in the right position , use ares or hades magic to do so . use ares blades in between , and be cautious with your attacks . remember that everything can be blocked , and parries will get you a free grapple , which will give you more magic . whenever you get enough magic again , use it ( preferably within " the combo" ) . if you do not have magic , keep using your amulet/stone , and get the wraiths in the air for long combos if you can . also , do your best to pull them out of the ground ( with r1 ) as soon as possible . once you kill all the wraiths , you have done it ! further notes the eyes of truth ( l2 + circle ) can also be used for some damage , although i did not use them at all . feel free to pepper it in whenever you want . if you are using " the combo " too much , you may not have enough magic for some of the recommended times . if this is the case , it is definitely possible to get through all of the second platform and the centaur on platform three without using magic . sometimes , when using the stone , your shadow kratos thinks you want him to kneel down in place . while this is annoying , i think the trick to making sure he fights is to hold down triangle when you use it . it seemed that if i just tapped triangle , he would kneel down , then disappear . it might also have to do with proximity to enemies . if you still have it , there is a club that you may have picked up from just before this . this can be used to make any of the phases easier by using the jump + circle attack , then hitting circle twice more once on the ground again . the jump helps because once you are on the ground again , the " cooldown " of the attack disappears , so you get extra attacks from it . it is pretty easy to ring out an amazon on the second platform with the club . overall , the main facets of god of war ( and any game really ) still apply . you have to be observant , quick , and adaptable to succeed . learn your enemies attacks and when/how to react to them . do not fight too many things at once ( this is when you use " the combo " to get rid of at least one ) , and pick when to capitalize on your opportunities . most importantly , be patient ! it may not be easy ( it is not supposed to be ! ) , but it is certainly not impossible . good luck !

that progress bar is for field upgrade score . you can read this question for what causes it to increase . when it hits 100% , you will stop gaining field upgrade score . for reaching the icons , you get different field upgrades depending on your current field upgrade path . the score is only for the current game , and you can lose it while playing .
i have used the shrine with my brother in co-op and can confirm that it works with putting players in the pit . firstly , you only get one lever pull when the zone loads , so it is important not to pull it before your sacrifice is in . once they are in , pull the lever , and the top shuts . flames turn on inside the pit and the sacrifice ( slowly ) dies . once they die , the shrine provides some loot . we did this around level 15 on the first playthrough , and the loot was not very good . i would be interested to know if the loot gets better on playthrough 2 or by putting more players in the pit . i am not sure if this works on npcs , if you could even manage to get one in there !

rockstar has a support page about this error . from there , i was also able to follow some links to arrive at this gta online status page , which states that ps3 's status is up as of february 10 . might be worth keeping an eye on that page to see if this is an ongoing outage with an estimated recovery time or just a temporary hiccup .
to do this you need to familiarize yourself with burrows and military alerts . http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/burrows the key is to make a burrow that is completely behind your defensive perimeter . then , you can access the military alerts screen ( default : m - a ) and set things up to restrict civilians to a particular burrow . at that point , whenever you change the alert , when the sieges and ambushes come around , your civilians will not leave the safety of their burrow . http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/df2010:scheduling

no , you do not get access to guest passes in the digital download version of diablo 3 . they are only in the retail version .
part of the problem with building facilities is that you are tying up resources that could be allocated elsewhere . when you start building , the funds are deducted from your account immediately , but the building takes time to construct . if you can not finish a satellite facility before the end of the month , you have taken a chunk of change out of your account that has no benefit for the current month . you can not launch new satellites and get your money 's worth out of your investment before the new month rolls around . at that point , you will have more cash available . therefore , it is possible that you could get some sort of benefit out of these resources by allocating them differently in the short term . maybe a bit of research will complete , and you can devote those resources to building something that finishes immediately , or perhaps you will get hit by something you are not expecting ( loss of an interceptor , a council request , etc ) and can use the cash to deal with the evolving situation . also note that one of your assertions is incorrect - you can build satellites without uplink capacity . there is a warning on the build screen for the satellites , but you can ignore it if you wish . therefore , at the start of the month , you can start building both the uplink and the satellites , and launch them in the same month .
if you log off and there are no other players online , the server should immediately unload all chunks and all mobs within .

evidently , other people have this issue , or similar as well . sadly &mdash ; because of the arrangements with disney &mdash ; support for tiny death star is scarce . the knowledge base for tiny death star reveals only two separate bugs related to game progress , neither of which seems to match the described issue . there is this discussion about it on reddit ; this bug appears to be present on both ios and android in one way or another . as a conclusion , contacting disney support seems to be your best bet right now .
that is a bug associated with followers that already have a default bow in their inventory ( this is usually the hunting bow ) . . . . followers who start with any kind of bow in their inventory are bugged so that placing a different bow in their inventory will have no effect . it may look as if they equipped the new bow , but the follower will switch back to their default bow as soon as combat starts , even if that bow was removed from their inventory . source : http://uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:followers#follower_equipment i have noticed that at least several followers seem to prefer to use their own personal ( non-inventory ) hunting bow over at least some more powerful bows you might give them to use . so far the only way i have been able to get a follower to consistently use the bow i provided to them is to console remove the hunting bow several times until they stop equipping it . it took about 5 removed before it worked with aela , using the command ( targetted on her ) removeitem 10e2dd 1 . . . for console-users that do not have the luxury of the in-game console , giving your follower a forsworn bow seems to be something of a workaround . it appears to be the only type of bow that totally overrides the default hunting bow in a companions choice of weaponry . it is certainly not the best bow in the game , but it is still a damn sight better , especially since it can be upgraded and enchanted . source : http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim_talk:followers#equipment_ai_bug_.28bows.29 if you are playing on the pc , you can use mods that will fix that bug , like follower hunting bow fix , dfb - disable-show follower bow and arrows or followers hunting bow replacement . the followers overhaul mod , better followers , allows you to remove the hunting bow from your follower , forcing your follower to use the bow you gave him or her .
edit : as of minecraft 1.5 or so , slime spawning has changed yet again . right now , slimes will only spawn in certain chunks of your map , depending on the map 's seed . there are tools online such as this one that let you input your seed , and it will output the chunks of your map that will spawn slimes . slimes spawn within 16 blocks of bedrock , in any light conditions . i think they were removed in the 1.2 beta , but it is confirmed that they have returned in 1.2_01 . slimes spawned fairly frequently back in alpha , but i believe notch reduced the spawn rates by quite a bit since then . the 1.3 update increased the slime 's spawn rate yet again .
the only thing that makes dual-wielding easier ( or harder ! ) is the one-handed skill ( or lack thereof ! ) . redguards start with the highest one-handed skill , but this initial advantage is not anything that other races can not overcome with a little bit of effort .
as the other answers have stated , once the game is registered with an account , it is tied to it and that is that . however , another option you have that i have read about is to create a new email address and steam account for every game you get and register that game with that address . when you are ready to get rid of it , you can sell the steam and email account . all in all , not very convenient , but it works .
i made a pretty quick and dirty xp farm as such : find a zombie spawner , punch out all the blocks around it , leave 3ish blocks of space all around it , making a big dark room around the spawner . put water source ( s ) at one end of the room , pulling every zombie that drops to the other side of the room . make a 1-wide hallway for the water to flow into . where the water stream ends , put in a 1x1 vertical shaft for the zombie to drop down ( place this right after the water , do not let water flow down the hole ) . make the bottom of the " tube " out of glass so you can see the zombies inside the " kill zone " . leave a single block at the bottom so that you can swing your sword at the zombie 's feet . i made my vertical shaft high enough to take away almost all the zombie 's health . if the fall kills them , no xp bubbles . i got mine to the perfect height that i can 1-shot all the zombies with a stone sword ( you would not believe how fast this goes through swords ) . hope my description is not gibberish , i will get some screenshots later if this is not clear . = ) <code> | | s &lt ; -zombie spawner | | | wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww | | | &lt ; - vertical shaft - experiment with height | | g g &lt ; - glass g g &lt ; - air for swinging sword xxxxxxxx &lt ; - floor </code>
vega was tasked with gaurding shepard while shepard was in ' prison ' on earth . when the reapers attacked he helped ash/kaiden get to the normandy and helped them pick you up . so he is in your crew by pure chance .
any combination will work . it is been a while since i went through the ' small ' part , but even then you should just buy some basic dmg spells , and temp switch other classes to lowbie casters . in fact , for 99% of the game , black magic is weak , and vastly overshadowed by any melee : while the 9,999 dmg cap is visually reported , my knight and monk have hit for 59,999 ( at lvl 98/job level 99 ) ( per achievement page , so this is probably the hard internal cap ) . there is also certainly no need for a dragoon . if a boss is hard , keep levelling up , then come back .   simply choosing your favorite classes is fine ( a white mage , for heals , though , is recommended ) .  
actually there is nothing such as a low reflexes of the player , fifa 14 is a step towards more real football were you have more control of your player . yes , i do agree that it makes the game more difficult and does not magnetize the ball to player 's leg , but this is how it is , as i said more real . if you might have noticed a minor difference in sprinting between 13 and 14 , the players in 14 never sprint instantaneously also when they sprint quite a distance it increses the distance between the player and the ball making it easy to tackle . moreover , speaking about the difficulty , a same team is more difficult to play in fifa 14 compared to fifa 13 . also the professional and world class level of difficulty in fifa 14 is quite more challenging than in fifa 13 . i am not so sure of other levels , guess it is same there too . all it needs is patience . sometimes scoring no goals , getting aggitated and playing insanely might get you a goal in 13 but does not work with 14 . talking about the defences , i too feel somethings are odd for fifa 14 like you may not get your marker on the correct player when you press the player change button , when changing player is mannual or air balls only . and also the attacking players here have inherit sense to dodge the sliding tackle that you perform . sometimes they may also dodge it in the attacking rectangle , save themselves a penelty and as well score which is quite surprising . well the thing with fifa 14 is you need to be calm , keep playing and do not give up on defeats because every defeat in fifa 14 teaches you something new which is always usefull .
short of downloading a map viewer to determine where the closest crystal hearts are , there is no easy way forward . depending on how deep you explore and variance in luck , you can get streaks of crystal heart caverns and chests galore , or no interesting items sans torch pots . that said , you definitely should keep exploring caves ( and mining into new caves from existing caves wherever possible / you can find them ) . while exploring will obviously help your survival when you find new crystal hearts , it will also give you a chance to find silver and gold ore . your priority should be a gold pickaxe ( to mine meteorite ) , but after that feel free to throw all your excess silver and gold into defensive equipment . better gear is like getting crystal hearts , because it increases the number of hits you take ( though obviously your hp remains the same ) . as to finding silver and gold , floating islands tend to be full of them . consider building a skybridge of some sort to find islands , but if you do , mind the harpeys ( typo intentional ) .
update as of minecraft 1.0: server operators can use the command /toggledownfall to start or stop rain-/snowfall . original answer : vanilla minecraft has no command to change the weather . you will need to install a mod of some kind . however , it is difficult to recommend mods if you are set against bukkit — it rather dominates the server mod scene . in fact , i was not able to find a non-bukkit weather mod which is compatible with the current version of minecraft .
if your son does not mind " starting over " , i would recommend doing raf ( recruit a friend ) , this would allow for your son to level a character super fast to 80 along with being able to do it with yourself or someone else . for more information on recruit a friend
you could always play on peaceful , which removes all hostile mobs from the game . to remove just creepers , however , would require a mod of one kind or another . some of the links provided in the comments should help you out if that is your case . but if you just want to remove the ' hostile mobs ' problem entirely , playing on peaceful is the easiest way to solve this .
dragons are vulnerable to fire : well , at least some of them . there are many types of dragons , but they fall into two major archetypes : fire dragons and frost dragons . fire dragons are vulnerable to frost ( 25% weakness ) but resistant to fire ( 50% resistance ) . frost dragons are vulnerable to fire ( 25% weakness ) but resistant to frost ( 50% resistance ) . so if you are trying fire and it is not doing a lot of damage , switch to frost . but you should be able to tell what type of dragon it is by the type of breath attack it has .
controller support the question caleb linked shows several options for controller support . use a program to map the controller to keyboard and mouse presses , like xpadder . the minecraft joypad/splitscreen mod can also be used , and is far more integrated into the game ( tooltips and such ) . the xbox gamepad is natively supported . supports 1.6.4 , 1.7.2 and 1.7.10 using forge . crafting grid looking around for a bit on reddit , your best bet seems to be cjb 's quickcraft . i think you will still have to deal with moving a cursor with a gamepad , but at least there is no dragging items into the grid . according to the website , the latest version is for mc 1.6.4 , though another site lists it for 1.7.2/4 as well , so you might try it out ( if you do , feel free to comment or edit the results into this answer ) .
in general , your build in early game does not matter much . just make sure you phaselock those mutants as often as you can . if you are still uncomfortable with your build , try shifting into harmony to heal better . as for money , no , you can not store it in the bank , but just stop caring ! every time you die , you lose 7% of your current money—the less you have , the less you should be afraid of dying . i have never had problems with money—even if you miss that rare gun in the shop , it is not like you will not find a better one soon . there even is a reason and a way to keep you money low voluntarily : slot machines . there is a low but reasonable chance to win eridium there , and as cost of playing rises with the level of main quest , there is zero point in saving for later—money inflates , eridium does not ! my personal way of playing is to burn all my money in slots after each trip to battlefield . longest forays usually net me mostly two to three " rounds"—that is , gambling sessions that end in full inventory ( of course , buy inventory upgrades first ) . gamble ! no money - no fear of death ! accidental good gun ! average of 0.1916 bars of eridium per pull ! eventual " jackpot ! " badass challenge ! the only thing you need a lot of money for is " for the hoard ! " achievement - and accumulating 3,000,000 is fairly easy even at the end of normal , and trivial at the end of tvhm .
for a general guide on how loot spawns , see this question . the relevant point is that loot will only spawn when a player is in a donut around the building with an inside radius of 30m and an outside radius of 120m . you are probably parking your vehicle inside the 30m " hole " where loot spawning does not happen . you will have to park > 30m away from your target and approach on foot , or drop off a passenger in that > 30m zone before driving up to the building .
to call specific people missing , all you have to do is hold alt and click their hero icon at the top : then you will get a nice message like you described instead of the general lane one . also , besides just being able to call people missing , you can also announce that someone has returned by holding ctrl+alt and clicking their hero icon in a similar fashion .
all difficulties can be soloed . at least nightmare is still pretty easy . the fact that even inferno is soloable was also confirmed by a blizzard staff member : jay also states that it is absolutely possible to solo inferno since they did not design it to require cooperative play , however a well coordinated group will most likely perform better .

you have hit the end . it is just a loop of candy eating after that . you can keep throwing as many as you want though ! ( the loop starts at 1770 . )
i believe a hunter should pick up a leather armor by itself like he does with a crossbow . however you could draft him into military and assign him any weapon and armor which he will be using for hunting when he has no military duties .
originally found here copy and rename the server world folder into your solo save folder : C:\documents and settings\USERNAME\application data\.Minecraft\saves -or- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves start and quit a new solo game copy the . dat files from the new solo game into the corrupted world start the corrupted world in solo mode to check copy the repaired world back to the server folder and rename if that does not work , try deleting the \players folder in that world as a last resort ( player data will be lost )
the only way i could beat her was to blow up the generators around the outside of the arena and jump around like a madman until they stop shocking me . rinse and repeat for all four generators . then i just had to put a few bullets in her and she went down .
the ending based on your readiness level is locked in at the beginning of priority : cerberus headquarters . for the " best " endings your readiness rating needs to be over 4000 ; the percent is not what is important . you can reply each of the endings at the " locked " readiness level from an auto-save that will become available after you finish once . if you wish to raise your readiness level further , you will need to restart before priority : cerberus headquarters . source : http://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect-3/endings the above link also provides a breakdown of the differences between the endings . once you complete the game you can check your ending against the table to verify that you saw what you think you should have seen .
the jar of souls can be found in the defiled crypts beneath the cemetary of the forsaken . taken directly from the wiki : in each game there are four possible locations for tomb entrances below the cemetery of the forsaken . three of them are randomly-activated each game , and those three entrances randomly access the following four levels : one small tomb with no special events inside . one medium-sized tomb with a stairway down to a lower level , which leads down to the shattered crown item . one large tomb in which players will find either the jar of souls event or the matriarch 's bones event , but never both . the development hell level source
there is no parry in street fighter iv . something similar is Focus Attack . focus attack does not require a perfect timing which you need in parry . also , you can`t parry all upcoming attacks and you are not invincible when doing it . to do a focus attack , press and hold medium punch + medium kick at the same time and your character will start charging . there are a lot of differences between focus attack and parry : focus attack is an offensive move that can stun the opponent . it has three different " levels " depending on how long you have held it and only crumples ( "stuns" ) if it is a counterhit ( level 1 ) , unblocked ( level 2 ) , or always ( level 3 ) . focus attack does not completely negate the damage , you absorb it into your health bar as recoverable health . you should not focus when low on life , as you will die if you take 200% of your current hp as " recoverable " damage . you can only focus one attack , so moves which hit twice or just a couple of jabs or short will be able to penetrate the focus . throws , command grabs , and many ultras and specials that are called armorbreakers which will hit you regardless of focus . when this happens you will hear a sound like a pane of glass shattering . in order to cancel the focus attack , right after the parry , for instance , keep medium punch and medium kick pressed down and dash forward or backward . if you land a l3 focus attack or any other focus that crumples , you should immediately dash towards your opponent and execute your most powerful combo , ultra , etc . this is a great chance to deal damage .
the reason for this is that the default rover control keys ( awsd ) are also mapped to vehicle rotation . you do not notice on kerbin because the rotation power of command pods is too weak to overcome the gravity , but on low-gravity moons the effect becomes much more notable . there are , however , two ways , to solve this problem . method a : go to the settings menu and map the rover controls to other keys ( many players use ijkl , because that is the keys used by most of the 3rd party rover mods which existed before 0.19 ) method b : switch into docking mode , where the awsd keys control lateral movement , which is only available when you have rcs thrusters on .
steam supports sharing saved games across multiple devices with steam cloud . that is the good news . the bad news is that this feature also requires the games to support it and it looks like the longest journey is among those that do not . you can tell if a game will work with steam cloud by looking at the game 's page in the steam store : if steam cloud is supported , the page will say so in the game details section below the title , release date , etc . you could copy the saved game files yourself so long as you set them up in the correct location on the desktop if you do not plan to switch back and forth between the two machines or do not mind keeping the files in sync manually . according to this thread , the longest journey stores its saved games in %APPDATA%\The Longest Journey . you could use dropbox to sync the saves between the two locations , possibly setting up a symlink from the save location to your dropbox folder using mklink .
the mistfire wolf skill is account bound and will be available to all your characters . the chalice and tome are single one time uses , for just one of your characters . i am not sure on the rytlock miniature as i do not have one . http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/miniature_rytlock as my hall of monument miniatures are account based , i assume that your rytlock will be also , but this is an educated guess .
in order to play starcraft ii multiplayer , you must have access to a battle .netaccount that has a license of sc2 . an account will usually gain a license through one of two methods : purchasing a digital download with a battle .netaccount registering the cd-key from a retail copy to a battle .netaccount , which can only be done once per cd-key . if you want to play with another person , you will need to purchase two separate copies , and register them to two separate battle .netaccounts . you can not share one copy between two accounts .
from the " mods and texture packs " menu inside minecraft , click on " open texture pack folder " . go up one folder and down into the " saves " folder . that is where all your saved sp worlds are . each world is one folder . on a server , it generates a folder with the world data which is ( effectively ) identical to any of your saved games . this folder it stores in the directory it runs from . simply copy and paste .
on the wikia for league of legends it tells the projectile speed of a lot of abilities it does tell for amumu 's bandage toss ( 1800 speed and 1100 range ) . and for morgana 's dark binding ( 1200 speed and 1300 range ) .
before the update , the two missions that would give you the highest amount of money and rp were coveted ( $18,000/1450 rp ) and rooftop rumble ( $18,750/3275 rp ) hack and dash ( $12,000–$24,000/1520 rp ) , as well as chemical extraction ( $15,000-$30,000/3850 rp ) are other good jobs , but you have to work together as a team . the previous two jobs are easy to do by yourself . note , these amounts are on the hard difficulty , which means you just can not go rambo in the missions and think you will pass it . as for the new missions ( 5/13/14 ) i have not played them yet , but once i do , i will update my answer . this might be a helpful resource : http://gta.wikia.com/missions_in_gta_online
the only requirement is that a clan must have at least 10 members eligible for war . members who are new to your clan will be ineligible for war if they left their previous clan while a war was in progress . they will become eligible for war again when the previous war is completed . you can check your clan member list to see if any members are ineligible for war , and see when they will be eligible again . if you start the clan war while members are still ineligible , those members will not be able to participate . you can see when players will be eligible in their profile through clan 's chat room .
there are a few reasons to swap lanes . to get golems to the adc/support . most of the time when you see the adc/sup go top its when they are starting purple ( top right ) . this allows them to keep up cs/level with the opponent 's bot lane adc/sup . sending the adc/sup to a 2v1 lane will most likely lead to an early tower kill if the lane opponent is not good at wave clearing . this gives the team more jungle presence ( blue golem ) in the opponents jungle , and is also why adc/sup sometimes go mid . this works out even better if they can take out the early turret and get back to the lane with the opponent 's adc/sup before they can get their turret making them a turret up . if the teams adc/support will not trade well with the opponents adc/supp ( range or sustain or whatever ) . this is so the adc/support do not get shut down and pushed back to turret . competing with the turret for cs gets annoying : ) finally , and less likely , if the top counters the teams current top champ hard . sending a adc/sup against an opponents top will most likely shut them down cs wise and make it harder to get early farm/snowball the lane . one thing to remember if you are going to send your adc/sup top is that if they cant get the tower down , and get back bottom lane by 4-5ish you are risking a dragon to the opponent ( their adc/support is still bottom and able to help with dragon while yours is on the other side of the map ) . another important note , as of patch 4.1 , top and mid turrets gained 20 damage reduction from champion basic attacks . this makes lane swapping even more risky as the duo that goes bottom will not have this damage reduction to deal with .
the 1.13 patchnotes says that all players who have completet the quests should receive 1 free respec in hell difficulty . respecialization is now possible ! completing the ' den of evil ' quest will now additionally reward 1 free respec which can be saved . players who have already completed this quest should receive 1 free respec in hell difficulty . ********************Keeping answer for original question**********************  yes , as of patch 1.13 you can respec by collecting one of each essence and using them in the horadiric cube 1 of each of the essences --> reset of stats in v1.13 a new choice was added . a character can now respec their attributes . this is done by speaking to akara after completing the den of evil quest in act 1 . in that same version , after using all of the stat resets , if you are still unhappy with your build , you can go out and defeat each of the end bosses of each act in hell difficulty to receive an essence . they are just a bit more rare than keys are to complete the pandemonium event . only works in v1.13 or later source
there is no specific way to level up fast . ( well , there were exploits like that rsvp mission , but they are grinding and not fun . ) you just need to take missions slower - i.e. check level on main missions - if the main mission is of higher level than you , go look for some side missions . generally , if you do all of the side missions , you should have plenty of extra experience and be at least of equal level to main quests . shield points do not depend on your level - only on the shield equipped . to get high-level shields and other equipment , you need to either farm an area with monsters of decent level , or frequent vending machines in such areas . for example , if you are on a dam fine rescue quest and level 12 , there is no point to hang out in three horns divide - the area , enemies and vending machines are all level 8 , and you will never get a good drop there . tl ; dr : to get more hp , level up by doing more side quests . to get stronger shields , fight stronger enemies , ideally of your own level .
surviving your first winter can be hard , especially for new players . veterans can start a game in winter and still manage ( in fact , a few level in adventure modes require you to do so ) . the winter guide gives a few good pointers . temperature in addition to the three basic things you need to keep up to stay alive ( hunger , health , sanity ) , and to the task of avoiding getting killed , in winter your temperature becomes an issue . fire will warm you , but going away from fire too long will lower your body temperature . if it dips below 5 , you get cold ( visual indicator , edges freezing ) , if it gets below 0 , you start losing health . an evil sideeffect of this is that should you die and respawn , you will start freezing pretty much instantly again . having a heatsource near your respawn point ( fire , chest with logs/coal ) is recommended . insulation to mitigate losing temperature fast , you can wear protective clothing . things like a winter hat , rabbit earmuffs , beefalo hat , puffy vest . . . all slow down the rate you get colder . another easy ( cheap ) way to lower the freezing rate is a heat stone . warm one near a fire ( even holding it and standing near a fire works ) , you will get cold slower . as you figured out , the biggest problem with cold is that it makes it harded to stay away from your camp for a long time . a solution could be to have everything you need close to your camp . have a lot of berry bushes , crock pots , drying racks , twigs , grass , and trees . being near to rabbit holes ( in combination to a boomerang or traps ) can get you food as well . a trick i often use is that food does not spoil until it is removed from it source . use these ways to store food indefinitely : plant berry bushes , let them grow berries so that the berries are on when winter begins . since growing berries takes max 5 days , do not harvest berries after day 15 . have a boomerang ready when harvesting , so you can kill the gobblers , too . free food ! get a lot of crock pots ( 8 will do ) and make dinner in them without taking it out . cooked stuff does not spoil while it is in the crock pot . 8 pots filled with meat stew is enough food for 8 days of winter . get a lot of drying racks ( 8 will do ) and have meat dry . big meat takes 2 days to dry in summer temperatures , so start soon enough . jerky is amazing stuff , probably one of the best food sources in the game . it stacks nicely ( 20 for big , 40 for small ) , keeps long , feeds , heals and restores sanity . get a few farms ( 4-6 ) and have crops ready . as long as you do not harvest , they do not spoil . get livestock and store in chests . they do not spoil as long as they are alive ( and require no food to stay alive , curiously ) . disadvantage : killing them is naughty . now you have enough reserves to only need a small amount of daily food intake to survive . a few rabbits , one koalefant , a beefalo or two . . . will do . one pitfall : when killing innocent creates ( birds , rabbits ) , your naughtiness goes up . kill enough on a small timescale , and krampus appears . . . alternative another way to deal with winter is to spend ( parts of ) it in the caves , where it does not get cold . surviving in the caves comes with its own problems though , of which sanity is a major one , unless when playing as maxwell . opportunities then again , winter is not only about surviving . once you solved that part , there are a few things you should do in winter : hunt a few koalefants ( which in winter become winter koalefant ) for their winter koalefant trunk , the vital ingredient in puffy vest . hunt mactusk , to get the walrus tusk , the vital ingredient in a walking cane .
from my experience , the convoy is intended to have unbounded capacity . of course , there are technical constraints , but the game does not provide any provisions primarily intended to handle a " convoy full " condition .
galaxy-at-war is mass effect 3 's multiplayer . that is not the important bit - what you should be interested in instead is the " galactic readiness rating " . the idea is that the reapers are invading , and the galaxy is not , well , ready . how the main storyline resolves depends on the galactic readiness rating when you go on the final mission . there are three ways to increase galactic readiness rating : winning matches in mass effect 3 multiplayer using one of the mass effect 3 ios apps ( there are two : infiltrator and datapad ) here is where you can find more details on how to increase readiness . additionally , the mass effect wikia has a little more on it . that screen represents all aspects of galactic readiness , and will default to 50% for all mass effect 3 players .
brant and i have just tested this , and it appears that blizzard does stack between different wizards , much like any other dot or effect stacks per player . this means you will never be penalized for having the same class as a party member , which is always a good thing .
i found this video about phantom prospect assignment : there it literally says : get a 300 meter headshot my interpretation of this would be : make a ( single ) headshot of 300+ meters to be honest , 300 meter is super close in terms of sniper shooting . try playing on some big map with many players ( to make sure there are enough people running around/sniping ) as a recon . a good example would be operation firestorm where you often have snipers on the mountains . and snipers are normally a non-moving target making it very easy to headshot them ( unless they headshot you of course )
after trying to kill it numerous times , i came across the wiki for the game which had the answer to both questions ( assuming the wiki is accurate ) . it is indeed immortal and cannot be killed . the wiki says “it” , not “they” , which implies that there is only one . however , if you swim in the sea long enough , more and more sea snakes come on screen at the same time as seen below , so the wiki may simply be using inconsistent grammar . the immortality of the snakes has the side implication that the sea level is endless ( which makes it much more efficient to take the boat than to swim—maybe you get lost underwater and go in the wrong direction ) . it also means that you can get an unlimited number of candies , but you would need to use the boots of introspection to go beneath the seabed so that the snake can’t reach you , though even then , it becomes hard to kill the sharks who drop only a couple of hundred candies per shark anyway , so it’s not much of a candy-mine .
no , weapon weight does not affect power recharge for squad mates .
if i remember rightly it was world at war that had them on the mission select screen , and with the modern warfare games the only place you could see how many you had collected was by pausing during a mission
you cannot play the original world of warcraft as cataclysm changed the map , starting areas , and other things significantly . to clarify , this does not require you to buy any of the expansions , but it does require you to patch your game so that you are on the current version of the game . even without buying the expansions there are many changes that will effect how you experience the game .
yes , every point of skill gives you a little more benefit even if you do not use the perks . for instance , every point of speech craft improves merchant prices by 1% . every point of destruction lowers spell costs etc . even if you do not put perks into the skills , its still highly beneficial for you to have high skills . not to mention it also gives you more experience for leveling .
two world with the same seed are not almost the same , they are identical ( assuming made in the same minecraft version ) . animal spawning is excluded from being identical though . on the same coordinates they will be exactly the same ( when nothing is broken/placed at least ) . this also goes for the nether . if you go to same coordinates in world1 and world2 the place will be identical . the nether is " different " for you since you build a portal on another spot in world2 then in world1 , so your netherside portal spawned in a different location . if you write down the coordinates of your netherside portal in world1 and then go to those coordinates in world2 everything will be the same , except that there is no portal .
bawsaq is influenced by the online community and it is likely down due to server loads . games as popular as gta v almost always have connectivity issues the first week or two after release so it is probably related to server load issues . rockstar is also aware of the issues with bawsaq and you can check this article for updates it is current status . once it is is back up , if you need any help with the stock market here 's a guide i found useful .
