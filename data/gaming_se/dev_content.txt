they show the places where others have died . i tested this out with a friend . i played a match , got a kill on him and left the game . i checked the map and it showed the place he died at with heat .
when the host quits you are automatically transferred to single player . while not in a quest , you just reload the ui and you spawn in the single player lobby . everything you did ( bought something or changed something in your box ) is still done . during a quest the others will leave the quest and let you alone . the monster still has the same amount of live left and you still have the same items with you as you had before ( even traps and bombs are still placed ) but you will not get the other shakalaka ( cha-cha or kayamba ) .
trees can definitely be grown underground with sufficient light . according to this thread on the minecraft forums , you need 7 blocks of space above the sapling . ( perhaps this condition is not being satisfied . )
yes . for example , as a mage you will start out with purple robes : throughout the game you will find various armor sets , most of which have some sort of strength requirement in order to equip them . but equipping them does change the appearance of your avatar :
fraps is the most popular tool for recording in game videos . update : dxtory seems to be stealing a lot of frap 's userbase now , and according to totalbiscuit suffers less frame drops . fraps is a universal windows application that can be used with games using directx or opengl graphic technology . in its current form fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as : benchmarking software - show how many frames per second ( fps ) you are getting in a corner of your screen . perform custom benchmarks and measure the frame rate between any two points . save the statistics out to disk and use them for your own reviews and applications . screen capture software - take a screenshot with the press of a key ! there is no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot . your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped . realtime video capture software - have you ever wanted to record video while playing your favourite game ? come join the machinima revolution ! throw away the vcr , forget about using a dv cam , game recording has never been this easy ! fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560x1600 with custom frame rates from 10 to 120 frames per second ! all movies are recorded in outstanding quality . if you have windows media player please sample some of the movies captured with fraps below :
i think the answer from mbraedley is correct : the best way to handle this scenario ( allowing access to a single player at a time ) would be to use command blocks to teleport one player into and out of your quiz area . you can program a command block to teleport the nearest player to a set of coordinates like so : /tp @p x y z  i do not know what would happen if two players somehow managed to be the exact same distance from the command block ( i.e. . does just one get teleported , or do they both get teleported since there is a tie for the " closest" ) . this additional argument may be necessary to limit it to only one player : /tp @p[c=1] x y z  the next step is to create a circuit whereby clicking an " entry " button will teleport one player into the quiz area , deactivating this button so that it cannot teleport anyone else in until the player exits the quiz area by clicking a second " exit " button , teleporting them out . here 's one such example circuit i just threw together in my survival game : the blue blocks are buttons that feed their signals into and gates ( green blocks ) . the outputs of the and gates will activate command blocks ( shown here as redstone lamps at the bottom of the image ) and will also feed into the input of a t flip-flop circuit ( red blocks ) . the output of the toggle circuit runs behind the red blocks and feeds into an input of each of the and gates . when the toggle circuit is in the " off " state ( no output , as shown in the image ) then the signal from the right button is disabled and the right redstone lamp ( i.e. . command block ) cannot be activated . activating the left button will cause the left redstone lamp to activate and immediately flip the toggle to the " on " state . this will subsequently disable the signal from the left button and reenable the signal from the right button . this circuit should give you the ability to allow one player at a time to teleport into your quiz area via a button press . once they reach the end they can then press another button to teleport out and reactivate the entry button for the next player . i would also suggest enclosing the circuitry and your quiz area in bedrock , so your average player can not mess with any of it .
by the look of the comments , on the provided links , they all should work extending the kinect cable . super cheap cable : had to wait until the kids opened the kinect at xmas and was nervous this would not work as the " official " kinect cables are ridiculously overpriced . but this cable with it is extra length i needed to hook this from xbox to kinect worked flawlessely . standard cable : for people people who are wondering , this cable works great with the kinect ! so it is pretty much up to how much you are willing to spend , as they all should work just fine .
with the 1.9 skyrim patch there is no limit to the levels you can achieve , so you could get all the perks in theory . alternatively , on pc , there are mods that can give you extra perk points . for example i use spend dragon souls for perks . otherwise search the workshop for ' perk ' and see what you find : e.g. perk potions
it is generally a matter of weight and weapon type . one-handed weapons include daggers , swords ( not greatswords ) , war axes ( not battle axes ) , and maces ( not warhammers ) . these will generally max out at 20 weight ( with maces being the heaviest ) two-handed weapons include greatswords ( not regular swords ) , battle axes , and warhammers . most have over 20 weight , but greatswords can weigh a little less ( ~15 weight ) . jesse cox of omfgcata also notes you can tell by the orientation of the weapon in the preview window : two-handed weapons are tilted to the side one-handed weapons are shown vertically straight
in order to produce tvs , you will have to meet a fairly long chain of prerequisites , having to deal with production levels and profits : you will have to produce processors until you unlock the electronics hq . once you unlock the electronics hq , you will need to hit a certain daily profit threshold ( there is a quest for this from the electronics hq ) in order to unlock the " consumer electronics division " module . after you plop the above module , you will be able to plop a " consumer electronics factory " to which you can then add a " tv assembly line " module . once you have done all of this , provided you have the materials , you can start churning out tvs . tip : if you open your city specializations and select electronics , underneath the advisor , there is a button that says " guide me " . if you click this button , you will begin receiving quests ( some with monetary rewards ) that will walk you through the entire specialization process to the very end when everything is unlocked . make sure you are not currently being guided in other specializations , and that you have an empty quest slot ( maximum of 3 ) .
on the unofficial terraria wikia it is written that glowing mushrooms are found anywhere inside the stone layer . the official wiki just states that glowing mushrooms can be found in deeper parts of the underground . as of the most recent update , the area with glowing mushrooms is easier to recognize , because it is now its own mini-biome , with its own background and background music . it is still located only in the stone layer , in the deeper parts of the underground . the blue grass glowing mushrooms grows on , can be harvested and planted elsewhere , to make it easier to get more mushrooms . the grass can only be planted on mud .
it is basically a bug or an unfinished piece of code . from this thread you can see that many other people have it and one of the opinions is : this is a bug , an error , in the game . a " miser run " is one in which you avoid collecting coins , but in this case no goal number has been set . " desc " is short for for description . the programer placed this temporary text to remind himself ( or someone else ) to place description text for the miser run . in the original temple run game a miser run was running 500 meters without collecting any coins , so either this was simply a repeat performance it it was actually code that was copied over from the former game , but not completed . if you look in the main current objectives list you will see that it does not show up . i was able to make this objective disappear by starting a run and simply running off the first ledge without jumping . so do not worry about it , it is just there to take some free space . it might be updated in the future with new objectives ( i hope )
the gift only matters for the injured squadmate you will need to visit in the hospital . as you have noted , ashley prefers tennyson . kaidan , being a far more practical sort , prefers whiskey .
modifying your weapon is a bit of a convoluted process . first , you need both a modifiable weapon , and a weapon mod . for instance , you can only stick an smg mod on an smg - no smg means you can not use the mod at all . second , you need to find a weapon bench , or go to the armory on the normandy and use that . from here , simply click the appropriate weapon class , and then the red " modify " button . next , you want to select one of the two mod slots . note the counter here . if the number is 0/0 , that means you have no available weapon mods ( at least for this weapon ) . pressing the left/right arrow will let you browse through available mods , and the up/down arrow will move between the two mod slots . simply manipulate these two arrows until you have got what you want , and then press " confirm " on the lower left . ta da ! brand swanky new gun !
no . diablo history is the main reason why . jay wilson explains in at http://gamingbolt.com/diablo-iii-game-director-isometric-perspective-vital-for-the-game-and-wont-change.
i do not think there is a " best " set up . but here is a pretty optimized one : destroy all flowers . this will prevent butterflis from spawning . chop down all non-palm trees . the beetles on the palm trees are all worth 6,000+ . if you are think you might want to grow the normal trees again , leave one standing to harvest its fruit for repopulation . plant more palm trees if you wish . now the set up is done . when you go beetle hunting , chase away anything other than palm tree beetles ( wharf roaches , hermit crabs ) and only catch the palm tree beetles . if you still have a normal tree , i would recommend chasing away miyama , fruit , and dynastid beetles , they are not worth much . the giant stag grows on these trees , and is worth a decent amount , so catch that if you see it . i usually just walk in a circle around the beach , walk slowly and creep when you see a beetle . some of the rarer beetles have low tolerance for noise . it is also useful to note that you do not need to be any closer than the edge of the tree 's shadow in order to catch the beetle . if you get closer than that , you will most likely scare them away . i usually haul in 300k per trip to the island this way .
http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/meeko%27s_shack you can get this dog just by simply going to near his house . make sure you follow him when you first see him . afterwards , unlike the dogs you buy , you can tell him to head home and later pick him back up at the shack for free again . he does get annoying some times , since he will run blindly into traps and bark over and over and over and over during important events .
you should not have more than one chocolate bar . if you have more , it should display you have 2 chocolate bars \o/ ( a bug ? oo ) because it is not intended to have more than the one bar , you can not do anything with the additional bars .

in tournament play , it will register how many wins you get during the period of validity of the tournament ( displayed on the popup when you hover it ) . you can then compete with other players in the leaderboard . random matches are more casual . it will track your total win ratio but nothing more .
you need 5 sunburst to enter the ravana map . monsters in the mini dungeons of golden temple have a chance of dropping a sunburst .
despite needing to update mass effect 3 to run it , that patch was not the patch containing the resurgence pack ( as i had assumed ) . if you had like to use the new maps ( and eventually , weapons / characters ) , you need to actually access the dlc via " dlc " from the main menu - you can then " buy " the dlc for 0 biowarepoints , afterwhich , it will install and be available for use in multiplayer . kinda convoluted , and not intuitive at all . ( especially since it is free - why not simply patch the game to add the content if everyone gets it ? )
all diablo 3 auction houses ( both real money and gold ) are regional , one of the same three regions there are for servers : the americas , asia , and europe . additionally , hardcore characters are entirely separate from " softcore " characters - this means no trading and a separate shared stash , but it also means a separate pair of auction houses to boot .
yes , spells are kept after reincarnating ( it may be that you need to have some minimum of skill experience on the spell to keep it ) , but they lose a certain amount of skill experience . so you can get any spell on any class , which is also the only way to get the tera spells on prism/galaxy mages/skulls . the skill experience lost depends on how much mana you spend reincarnating , a genius reincarnation will only lose 5% . as the character will lose any excess mana they still have after reincarnating you should use the best one you can afford .

when a follower mysteriously disappears , there are one of three things that have happened : they are dead . sorry . if you want your stuff , you will want to find where they died . if she was with you up to just recently , backtracking should not be too difficult . they bugged out . this one 's pretty easy to resolve : enter a new area or fast travel somewhere . they will be right behind you . they went home . this is what the message refers to . return to where you picked them up originally : in the case of lydia , that means breezehome ( if you have purchased it ) or dragonsreach in whiterun .
implants drops are based on xp events , are random and higher awared xp have a higher chance for an implant drop . fact is : the current drop tuning is designed to allow average players ( by raw , non-boosted xp gain , across all characters ) to be able to maintain even tier 3 implants with drops alone . check it out for yourself . the loot system is more complex than just " kills per implant drop " or " xp per implant drop " , it is weighted and favors large xp events ( base captures , ribbons , alerts ) for better drops . no one has scratched the surface of the drop system on pts yet . - higby ( ps2 creative director ) source : http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/240luz/smedly_on_implant_drops/ch2qiq1?context=3 initially there were caps in place for drop rates but they got removed at 21.05.2014 . source : https://twitter.com/mhigby/status/469329397690822656 there are not more information available about the inner workings of the drop system .

the difficulty jumps quite often rely on the map you are playing on and vary quite a bit between maps . here is a general guideline of the difficulty levels you should expect . the information is taken from the doom wiki . for difficult level on individual maps , it is best to consult their corresponding wikia pages . source : doom wiki .
places you can safely store your items include any houses you buy , your companion ( s ) , and your horse . places considered to be owned by you ( and therefore contain safe containers ) are ( spoiler warning ) : arch-mage quarters ( after you become arch-mage ) the dawnstar dark brotherhood sanctuary ( after you have finished the dark brotherhood quest line ) i have personally stored items in my apprentice quarters in the college of winterhold without problems , however others have had stuff go missing from there , so be careful . other containers may not be safe . given what some other answers have said , gerder 's house does not seem like a safe place for long-term storage .

unfortunately , dota 2 heroes do not have " fun " names - picking a hero will give you a unit with their regular name . since the game is still in closed beta , i can not say with 100% certainty whether or not fun names will be added later , but i do recall a few of the names used in the past ( i believe kimahri might've been a nickname of phantom lancer ? ) are probably copyrighted by their respective source 's companies .
tip : if you want to spare more memory , you may set the -xms parameter even lower , say : java -Xms32M -Xmx512M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui  the parameter controls how much memory is reserved on startup . your server will start with 32mb ram and whenever it needs more memory it will allocate some until it reaches the maximum of 512m . however , this will result in a little slowdown whenever the allocation is done . source : http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/tutorials/setting_up_a_server#less_than_1gb_free_ram also you can check this website : http://www.canihostaminecraftserver.com/ with this you can have a small idea on how many players you can handle :d
yes , spike traps , along with every other thing in the game that deals damage , can be destroyed with retribution runes . unfortunately , you can only achieve that by allowing them to damage you enough that the returned damage is enough to destroy them , which i think depends on what area of the castle you are in .
are you sure the pet in question is charmable ? you need to find a " juvenile " version of the animal - not just any random mob . " hatchling " or " young " does not count ; it must be a juvenile ! be careful , because you might also be trying to tame another player 's pet - if a player has not named their pet , it will remain " juvenile x " , and may give no other indicator that it belongs to another player . finally , you may have already tamed one of those animals . rangers are limited to 1 of each unique pet - you can not tame multiple pink moas , no matter how cute you might find them .
there does not appear to be one . ( based upon in-game experience , and anecdotal evidence of others . )
here 's what i did for the chamber it sounds like you are describing : obtain a cube place a hard light wall over the turret pit so when you call for a cube it is not immediately emancipated hit the button and go catch it ( or if you are really lucky , it will bounce back enough to stay up ) go up near the exit with the cube use the light wall to prevent overshooting the catwalk once there , place a portal to block off the turrets this is before walking around to the ledge above the button go put the cube on the button portal out , using the one you blocked the turrets with ( orange in above picture would go on the surface to the left on this side of the emancipation field ) go back up to the exit if you get it down ( or do not mind getting more cubes ) , you can just throw the cube off the ledge onto the button and skip 3-6 entirely .
i am not sure what hp10pl is , but : ad - attack damage - the stat that directly affects melee auto-attack damage . many melee/fighter/tank champions will want to get ad gear to increase their damage . ap - ability power - the stat that directly affects ability damage . many mage/ranged champions will want to get ap gear to increase their damage . arpen - armor penetration - makes your ad attacks ignore some amount of the enemy 's armor when they hit . as - attack speed - the speed in which you attack with normal attacks ( not spells ) . ad champions benefit from this . b - 1 . back ; 2 . baron - 1 . to signify that you are going to recall into your base or otherwise retreat ; named either for the word " back " or for the fact that by default , pressing b initiates recall . 2 . refers to baron nashor , the boss monster who spawns at 15 minutes and is found near the top lane on summoner 's rift . blue - blue buff on summoner 's rift , from the ancient golem . provides scaling cdr and bonus mana/energy regen . bot - generally refers to the bottom lane in summoner 's rift and twisted treeline , or the champions who are laning there . e.g. , " bot mia " = " the enemy champions in bot lane are missing , beware . " on dominion , this refers to the lower-left or lower-right capture points , as well as the bottom lane in general . carry - heroes , usually ad heroes , capable of dealing massive damage and taking down entire groups , but usually die themselves easily too ( they " carry " the entire team for the damage ) cc - crowd control , which refers to abilities that restrict a champions ability to act or move , such as slows and stuns . cdr - cooldown reduction - the more % , the quicker the cooldown on spells is over ( a maximum of 40% ) . usually good for casters or heroes without mana . cs - creep score - the count of the number of creeps minions you have killed . higher number means you have been better at last hitting , and have more gold to spend . dive - tower diving , the fact of attacking an enemy under his tower , usually to deal a killing blow on a low-health champion . doing so makes the tower attack the diver , making it a risky move . drag - dragon - the boss creep near bottom lane on summoner 's rift . gank - to gang up on an enemy champion by surprise and kill him/her . gp10 - gold per 10 seconds . how much gold you generate per 10 seconds , by items , runes or masteries . useful for support champions . hard leash ( red/blue ) - same as a normal leash ( see below ) , but leaving the monster with very little health ( around ~10% ) and the jungler finishes the monster without using smite ( usually to save it for the other buff since he will not be receiving help this time ) . imo - in my opinion , sometimes imho - in my humble opinion . this is a common abbreviation across the web , and is not limited to online games . ks - kill steal - when someone finishes an enemy , but other teammate wanted to perform . leash ( red/blue ) - helping the jungler with a neutral monster until the monster is at ~30-40% of health at the beginning of a game , so that the jungler can use smite to finish it ( usually people leave the area so that the jungler gets all the experience ) . mia - missing in action - means that the enemy in your lane ( or the specific enemy you mention ) is no longer visible in your lane , and may be on his way to " gank " a teammate . everyone should be careful and watch out for the missing champion . also used : " miss " or " ss " mid - refers to mid-lane in summoner 's rift , or the middle level of capture nodes in dominion . mm - matchmaking - the system in lol that teams up people/puts them against each other . mp5 ( aka mp/5 ) - mana per 5 seconds - a stat referring to how much mana your champion recovers every 5 seconds . mpen - magic penetration - makes your magical attacks ignore some amount of the enemy 's magic resistance when they hit . proc - refers to an item 's or an abilities ' activation due to some other action , usually but not always a basic attack . examples include phage 's move speed buff ( basic attack ) , vel'koz ' passive ( spell damage ) , vi 's denting blows ( both basic attacks and spell damage ) , caitlyn 's headshot , etc . pull ( red/blue/drake ) - the fact of hitting a neutral monster , usually at range , so that it will follow you for a few seconds , allowing another champion to attack it without getting damage . you will find this typically at the beginning of the game , with the carry pulling the golem/lizard for the jungler . as of season 3 , this no longer works on red or blue . red - red buff on summoner 's rift , from the lizard elder . scaling damage over time and slow . sr - summoners rift ( 5v5 map ) - the most played map , the classic dota 5v5 . has 3 lanes , the dragon mob and the boss nashor . also : " rift " top - top lane in summoner 's rift/twisted treeline , or the upper-left/upper-right capture points in dominion . tt - twisted treeline ( 3v3 map ) - the smaller map for 6 players , has 2 lanes . tp - teleport - summoner 's spell
looks like loading the game from a previous save fixed the issue .
this is how it works : every time you enter a portal , the game looks for an exit portal inside +/-128 blocks square ( y is irrelevant ) . if you enter a portal at x=100 , y=60 , z=200 in the overworld , this corresponds to x=12 , y=60 , z=25 in the nether . the game scans a square from ( x=-116 , z=103 ) to ( x=140 , z=153 ) , for all y values from 0 to 128 . the closest portal in that space is where you appear . if there is no portal in that area , one will be created in a suitable place . since there is a chance the x=12 , y=60 , z=25 will be obstructed , the game will search for an open space in that +/-128 blocks square . if such space is found nearby , all will be good , the new portal will lead back to the same one in the overworld . however , sometimes the game will put the nether portal far from the starting point , if it can not find other suitable place . let 's say it puts the nether portal at x=80 , y=60 , z=110 ( this is still in the +/-128 bounding box ) . when you enter that portal the game will search the corresponding space in the overworld : starting from x=640 , z=880 , it will search the +/-128 blocks - from x=512 , z=752 to x=768 , z=1008 . as you may notice , the original overworld portal is well outside this box . so the game will create a new portal in the overworld . this is what is happening in your world . to fix that , write down the coordinates of the portal in the overworld ( use f3 to get them ) and divide them by 8 . enter the nether , go to the calculated coordinates and create a portal from the nether . you do not have to be exact , as long as you are within 16 blocks from the calculated coordinates ( you need to match only x and z , y is irrelevant ) . then the game should find the original overworld portal . or : move the overworld portal using the above logic . in described situation , there is no way to make the two portals lead to each other without moving either of them . i would move the nether portal and if the new position is outside of the fortress , i would build a short safe walkway to the fortress . here is a crude drawing of the process :

spare parts grants a chance for sentinels to drop rare resources upon destruction . from the wiki : a sentinel will not drop a resource if queued for a regen . a sentinel destroyed in pvp will not drop a resource . a sentinel will not drop a resource more than once per mission if revives are used by the player .
the system is levelled - you will not find hugely difficult things you cannot beat . except giants . actions that level up skills : attacking someone with a weapon casting a spell on someone or something ( things like clairvoyance do nothing ) sneaking and not being seen in the presence of enemies opening a lock - seems breaking a lockpick also gives skill xp picking a pocket buying or selling something . successfully persuading/intimidating someone ( i think ) training some quest rewards ( finding the anden family sword gives you +1h and +block ) creating a piece of armour or a weapon enchanting/disenchanting something taking damage whilst wearing armour making a potion or a poison the list is not exhaustive , though .
kirrahe will survive if you take out the geth fliers by disabling the landing strips on your way into the compound . if you do not , he will die to an air assault . how much of his team survives depends on what shepherd does with the alarms when entering the facility - the renegade option means less will survive , but " how much " of his team survived does not get carried over . the wiki has a little more .
as of patch 1.04 , as you found out , you can turn Weapon Taggingon/off in the settings , but not the minimap itself , or the radar function . you can turn off the hud completely , or turn some elements by applying some unsupported patches to your game . i know , this is not what you asked , but there seems no other way . this guide explains how you can apply changes manually . this forum thread lists some of these community patches . beware , you might be kicked/banned from multiplayer games if you play it with these on , so , make a backup of what you are overwriting . update : the above mentioned patch files are apparently no longer hosted due-to copyright violations . update 2 : you can download the patch ( for version 1.04 ) that removes the enemies from the mini-map here .
assuming you do not want to break the station in to separate stations and use a load of feeder links , you will need to tweak the advanced option that limits your maximum station spread . this advanced setting ( specifically Stations→Max station spread ) can be adjusted to values between 4 and 64 , with a default of 12 , and determines the maximum size square that can be allowed to bound each station ( whether compound or not ) . the recommendation is to only increase this if you are using the yapf pathfinder , but this is the default so if you have never tweaked that setting there is no need to worry . for more information , you can see the wiki entries for the setting and station spread . if you need a station larger than 64 by 64 , well then i think you are stuck ( and possibly doing it wrong ) .
i was wondering if you could play rock band on no fail and just blast out songs karaoke-style yes , but only in rock band 3 . this is called " all instruments mode " ( aim ) and can be enabled in the per-user overshell settings . that is the menu at the bottom of the screen for each player . ( look ma , no vocalist ! keys/drums/guitar/bass ) in aim , there is no vocalist player with a controller , it is basically karaoke mode . full easy harmony vocals are always on and scrolling across the top of the screen . any connected microphone , up to 3 , can sing any part of the song -- or not -- at any time . it is completely optional but always on for walk-ups . there is no vocalist scoring in this mode though , so all you can do is get streaks and see how you do on each vocal segment . that also means you can either sing lead ( blue line ) , harmony #1 ( orange line ) , or harmony #2 ( red line ) from any microphone .
i believe you are referring to dead ops arcade . here 's an explanation i found of how to access it . accessing it is not just a matter of finishing the game . you have got to bust your way out of the main menu screen , then work your way around to a terminal and type in the correct commands to boot the game . while in the menu look down ( using the right analogue stick , presumably ) at your hands and mash the triggers to wriggle your hands until they come free . you will stand up and be given the freedom to roam . go to the terminal , access it and enter cd , then doa . bam - giant machine guns , flame throwers and rocket-firing bats are yours for the shooting .
i think it is definitely worthwhile playing portal first . i just started portal 2 and would probably have been a bit lost without having played portal first . there is almost no introduction to how the portal-gun and other stuff works in portal 2 and there are a lot of references to the previous game . it makes portal 2 an even better game if you have played portal .
the portal must be rectangular ( e . g . 3x3 , 4x2 , 3x5 , but no circles ) . it has a maximum internal size of 21x21 . it must be at least 3 tall , and at least 2 wide ( not including the frame , with the frame that ends up as 5x4 ) . if you build multiple portals in front of each other and light them , only the rear most portal will be visible , but all will function . this may be a bug .
i also think that some of these fights are pretty unforgiving . this is what helped me : if you have to mash left/right , do it as quickly as possible . sometimes , when i was slacking and pressing it at a relaxed pace , i failed the combat . exclamation mark - hit melee attack ( defaults to f on pc ) red hand - hit use command ( defaults to e on pc ) you will get notification that a command is coming up , there will be a circle around the icon that will be shrinking rapidly . . when it shrinks to zero , the icon will be lit , as it were , and that is when you have to press it . the preparation phase is about 1 second long .
stat allocations are based on class , and are the same across all players . unlike diablo ii , there is no input required to assign stats on level-up . it is just free stats that happen the same for everyone ! as far as i am aware , your character will always gain : +3 primary stat +2 vitality +1 to both secondary stats .
there are no resources i know of that will track your games played per race if you have not already started tracking them , but going forward , you might consider , sc2gears . sc2gears from their website : sc2gears is a general starcraft 2 utility for everyone who is interested in the game ( either a player or just a game analyzer ) . its main features are replay management and analysis for both individual replays and mass replays ( multi-replay statistics ) . it provides easy but powerful and efficient replay management and basic statistics for starters , and advanced statistics and time development charts useful even for professional players . it is also a great asset for tournament and league organizers in quick analysis of tournament results . you can even use it to share your replays with a few clicks on different replay sites . i have been recently trying this tool myself , and there are lots of feedback around the web that it is a really helpful tool in analyzing your play and your stats like this . so , once you have sc2gears installed , how can you track your race usage ? first , load up sc2gears , and then double click on " sc2 auto reps " . this will pull all the replays you currently have in your sc2 folder . i would recommend you start using sc2gears to catalog all your replays , or turn on the new patch 1.2 option to never delete replays . once you double click on " sc2 auto reps " , a report will come up listing out all the information for your games . from here , click the " multi-rep analysis " button at the top of the chart . this will create a report for you with all the fun statistics you are looking for ! most likely your username will be at the top row ( since you will have played the most games ) , and it will show in the " races %" column exactly what you are looking for .
i am almost sure it is , for the exact same reasons as you : the nature and the value of the card seems to be taken into account even before you effectively select and reveal it ( and hence can trigger achievements , for instance -- it happened to me as well ) . which , by the way , makes this system a bit pointless , not only because at the end of the day , you choice does not matter , but also because you will have to wait for everyone to chose his card before you can proceed to the next screen .
edit : updated for 1.0.4 you can cancel any auction , so long as no bids have been made on it yet . if you want to change the buyout price , you will need to cancel the auction ( assuming no current bids ) , and re-list it with the new starting/buyout prices ) . the ability to cancel auctions with no bids was added in patch 1.0.4 . prior to that , the following historical answer was valid : you have 5 minutes from the start of the auction to cancel it . once you are past that 5 minute mark , there is no way to end the auction early , short of someone purchasing the item via buyout . you cannot change the minimum bid or buyout price once the auction is started . your only options are to wait and see if someone buys it , or possibly give someone else ( that you trust ! ) the money for the buyout , have them buy it , give it back to you , and put it back on the ah at a new price . keep in mind that you will wind up losing money this way to the ah fees , however .
so i wrote this post a long time ago and everything here still applies , however , there is one day9 daily that has happened since that deserves mentioning : the mental check list i will admit its a really good one , but not so good that i could not just add it to the current list of dailies . to be worth its own section i would need something like : the day9 coacher that is right , someone took the mental check list daily and made it into a program you can use . . . to get better . now i do not mention this a lot but my day job is a programmer , so the first thing i did was crack it open and start adding new sounds : spreed creep vomit larva stop playing so badly these are trivial to implement and since he provides source code , you can even toss in whatever you think is appropriate . i learned large portions of my knowledge by watching the day9 dailies . i believe he not only offers a steady supply of high level play and in depth analysis , but he also highlights issues that newer players often have . as a starter i would suggest the following : idra 's solid zvp opening brat_ok 's tvp special white_ra 's pvp blink stalkers back to the basics gold level 2v2 plugging leaks in silver level play learning from a loss fine tuning an opening among other things he will stress the importance of : splitting and rallying workers sending builders prior to having the minerals " normal " build orders having lots of " stuff " keeping minerals and energy low ( for macro ) powering drones transferring workers expanding when you attack timing pushes i would also avoid anything with thelittleone ( tlo ) in it . while his style is amazingly fun to watch , he plays on such a high level that little can be learned from his replays until you are more advanced . now once you have watched all those and practiced your builds my next advice is practice moar . to help with this i suggest yabot . it'll allow you to practice your builds again and again without having to load a new game ( it has an in game reset ) . smooth out your builds till you start playing like machine after that you can look at gosu coaching to help bring your play up to more competitive standards . also , if you need a practice partner my starcraft 2 account email is tzenes@gmail . com there are also a number of good articles here on gaming . se : what build order should i use for zerg in starcraft 2 what are popular opening builds for terran in starcraft 2 what are popular build orders for protoss in starcraft 2 scouting in starcraft 2 there is also a good article on sc abbreviations on battle .netas well as a beginners guide
http://m.ign.com/articles/1153613 it looks like there are unlockables like weapons and medals . i do not see achievements . the link above has a list of all the unlockables . unlockables will carry over to the release version .
when minecraft 1.2 is released , using the new “anvil” file format , biomes will be stored in the chunk data so that they can be redefined on a per-column ( x , z ) basis . you will need an editor which supports doing so , or a generic nbt editor , of course . ( source )
what we have got definitely is not comprehensive , and portions may be too specific : = settlement = house = wheat mill = lumber mill = farm = stable = port = mine = shack = lighthouse = imperial army camp = stormcloak camp = nord tower = imperial tower = fort = dragon + word wall = standing stone = barrow/tomb = surface encounter = giant camp = cave = daedric shrine = dwemer ruins = camp = orc stronghold = ship = pond/clearing = grove = mountain pass = generic point of interest . ( guild halls , some quest encounters , ect . . . ) = quest marker - the quest is in the same zone as you . = quest marker w/ door - you must pass a loading screen to get to this destination . in addition , each city have a unique emblem , as do each palace . ( images from the uesp )
yes - the water table does replenish the water table in simcity is replenished from the following sources ; rain water from shorelines sewage treatment plants other cities outflow pipes from industrial buildings rain is not a reliable source of replenishment but does contribute . due to its random nature ( it never rains when you want it to ) you should never rely on your water table being replenished by rain . water from the shorelines however does replenish the water table a lot faster than water from rain , but seemingly not fast enough to cater for a sudden explosion in population . the outflow pipes from industrial buildings will put polluted water back into the ground . this does not show up as blue but even so , it is still water . it will need treating before it gets to your sims but it is still present on the water table . sewage treatment facilities will replenish the water table during their normal operation . sure they are pretty expensive to place but if you are heading towards a high population city you will need to cater for replenishing the water table just as much as getting garbage off your streets or keeping everything powered . some tips for managing your water simcity is not simcity 4 - large cities are not supposed to be self sufficient . this is managed by the ' multi-city ' game mechanic and if you want clean and efficient cities with large populations you are going to have to import some of your water see water management as a challenge you are going to have to overcome along the way through proper planning and preparation slow down ! the purpose of the game is not to get a massive population in as little time as possible , the goal is to create a stable region consisting of multiple cities that compliment each other some cities may be your population centers and some cities may be mining hubs , and these cities are going to be thirsty , but other cities in the region may have an abundance of coal or oil , and these smaller cities can provide the water to your population centers the best advice for a perpetual water supply build a water pump next to a sewage treatment plant . the sewage treatment plant will replenish the water table as fast as the water pump is depleting it , thus providing the effect of infinite water . it is also a good way to pick up germs and make your population sick in the instance of a sewage overflow , so filtration pumps at your water pump may be the way to go with this .
honestly , you might be looking at an incompatibility between the router 's implementation of 802.11 and what the ds is expecting ( some random extension to 802.11 or something that is confusing the ds ) . can you get your isp to give you a different model of router maybe ? or do you have another wireless access point you can use in place of that one ( or behind it ) ?
a simple explanation . . . travel between dimensions in minecraft is always mediated by portals . gaining access to the nether requires that you build a nether portal out of obsidian blocks , and since endermen can not move obsidian blocks , they can not build the portal to get there . however , movement between the end and the overworld is possible for endermen because : end portals already exist by default in overworld strongholds . the ender dragon has the ability to create a portal leading from the end to the overworld , as evidenced when it is killed by the player . also , endermen just spawn normally in the overworld . if you were to stand on one side of a nether portal with an enderman on the other side and look at him , he would walk forward and travel to the nether , which mobs can do as of 1.4.2 .
you do have 100 health , only the exact number is not shown on the hud . continuous damage will kill you , but your health fully regenerates very quickly when you are not damaged for a bit . you can observe this in portal 1 by giving yourself the hev suit ( console command give item_suit , needs sv_cheats to be enabled ) , which causes your health to be visible . in portal 2 , issuing ent_dump player after being shot at by a turret displayed the following , so it is pretty safe to assume that it works the exact same way as in 1: ] ent_dump player [...] max_health: 100 health: 10 [...] 
i am doing my sl1 run right now and for me raw damage output per blow is definitely not all that matters . i prefer to have a weapon with a nice move set and i have upgraded two hand axes with lightning and fire for quite decent damage ( 400 total for +5 lightning ) and really fast blows with low stamina drainage ( = around five blows in quick succession ) . but sure , for maximum damage the reinforced club is the way to go as far as i know .
the valentine 's day angry birds was an update to angry birds seasons . the update added more levels with a valentine 's day theme . currently there are two paid angry birds games out - angry birds and angry birds seasons - the valentine 's day is not a separate app .
after conducting some research , i do believe the answer is no . once you have your damage maxed , blood lust will not increase your damage further . on my latest play through with samson , i picked up the small rock , growth hormones , blood of the martyr and a lump of coal , so my damage was nice and maxed . i then proceeded to face gish , who spawns clots quite frequently . taking care to hit gish just once and then proceed to kill a heap of clots before trying that again , it seemed like each of my hits still took down ~9px of gish 's health bar , which was exactly the mount of damage i did straight through the door .
the three most important imo are the rest all make sense based on what they are called . examples : hearty means the monster will have a higher hp than a monster without it . strong means a monster will have higher strength . pinch hitter means the monster can learn abilities that can be activated when in danger , etc . there are some that are element +prone which means the monster is weaker against that element . some are element +proof which means the monster has a strong resistance to that element or will learn resistance abilities for that element . for completeness : as mentioned by yuck , only the first three attributes define the monster . the fourth attribute has no in game effect for your monster and is there for fun . see yuck 's answer for more information .
multiplayer games simply have multiple players playing the same game at the same time . usually in our day and age , " online " is assumed when one mentions multiplayer , although this is not always the case . cooperative games typically feature multiplayer elements , but are typically focused on a subset of multiplayer games where the overall goal is to work together , usually against a non-human opponent .
there are two schools of philosophy on drone transfer ( this only is for drones on minerals ) : all but 16 half ( or really any other number between this and #1 ) both have their merits . the first is based on the assumption that any unit after the 16th is only doing a fraction of the work it could do otherwise ; transferring those means you gain more minerals without any additional cost . most companies would kill for this opportunity . the latter is based on the idea that when powering drones you do not want to have to select your hatcheries individually , so by doing this both sites need just as many new drones and you can power without noticing location . this often falls under the criticism that any drones being transferred are not producing minerals ; this is fine when they are at reduced effectiveness , while it is a bad idea under 16 . while this is true , any drones produced at one base and rallied to the next suffer from the same problem , so the net loss is actually zero ( unless you do not rally , in which case your economy is slowed for other reasons ) . if you start playing with really ridiculous math ( ridiculous because of the assumptions you have to make ) you should find out that the net effect is the same . you will notice that pro players tend to favor the former as more money now is better than the same money later . so , my suggestion is : all drones on minerals but 16 .
you get the feathers by catching the chirri with the bug catching net . now i know you said it , catching them is hard , but it is actually easy once you know the secret . to be able to catch anything that could be caught , you need to sneak up on the target ( i.e. . , walk up to it ) and swing your net at it . it is easiest to swing sideways leading with the wii remote turned sideways . this applies to anything that is evasive or would otherwise run/fly away . what i would do is sneak up to it with your net out and touching the target . once you do that , swipe and it should be yours . here 's a video demonstrating how you could do it :
from what i have heard and experienced , your followers are predetermined to wear a specific kind of armor . for example , if i give lydia light armor , she will not wear it , even if she has nothing else equipped because she is preset for heavy armor only . i did experience a similar issue with lydia , though minus the nudity . i tried to give her a light armor helm . i would see her wearing it right after i equipped her with it , but after a couple of fights , it was gone . the item was still in her inventory but she simply refused to wear it . i believe this is because the light helm does not meet her armor requirements . in your case , regular clothing would not fit your housecarls preset armor specifications so they are simply unable to keep these items equipped . that said , i do not think there is anything you can do short of using the console to force her to wear it .
since the only items impossible to obtain in peaceful are mob drops ( that are not obtained otherwise ) and derivatives , here 's a list of unobtainable items : blaze rod music discs ( with the exception of music discs "13" and " cat" ) ender pearls ( even though you can obtain an eye of ender by trading ) spider eye ghast tear slimeballs magma cream nether star wither skeleton skull there are only a handful of direct derivatives : brewing stand ( requires blaze rod ) this leads to no potions as well , especially those that use a fermented spider eye , ghast tear , blaze powder , or magma cream sticky piston ( requires slimeball ) beacon ( requires nether star ) the wither ( requires 3 wither skeleton skulls , but you are not going to spawn that on peaceful anyway ) fire charge ( requires blaze powder ) also limits available fireworks and here is the list of drops you can still obtain : bone ( can be found in temple and dungeon chests ) rotten flesh ( before snapshot 12w22a could be traded with villagers but can also be found in temple and dungeon chests ) strings ( obtained by : destroying cobwebs and tripwires and it has 53% chance of spawning in a dungeon chest ) arrows ( can be crafted with other resources available in peaceful , can be found in temples and can be traded with villagers ) gunpowder ( will be possible to loot in dungeon chests ) gold nuggets ( can be obtained by placing a gold ingot into a crafting area ) dragon egg ( reaching the end is possible by trading eyes of ender with villagers ; apparently the ender dragon will not despawn on peaceful and the creation of a piston is still possible ) glowstone dust ( can be obviously obtained in the nether and by trading with villagers ) it is also to note that a lot of items , that are possible to obtain , will not be renewable anymore , like : bone ( previously farmed by killing skeletons or wither skeletons ) coal ( not charcoal , previously farmed by killing the wither skeleton ) gunpowder ( previously farmed by killing creepers , ghasts or witches ) strings ( previously farmed by killing spiders and cave spiders )
the system is mostly the same as it was in borderlands 1: beating playthrough one does nothing except unlock playthrough two ( "true vault hunter mode" ) , beating playthrough 2 scales enemies and rewards to your level , unlocking playthrough 3 ( if you are level 50 , i believe ) . playthrough 3 is new and scales to your level from the start . true vault hunter mode ( playthrough 2-2.5 ) playthrough 2 is unlocked simply by beating playthrough 1 , and is identical to playthrough 1 until completion except with higher level requirements , higher level enemies and generally harder enemies . once you beat playthrough two , enemies scale to within 3 levels of you ; some weak enemies ( like skag pups ) may be level 48 , most enemies will be level 49-51 , bosses will often be level 52 , and occasionally enemies will even be 53 . this is known as " playthrough 2.5" as it was in borderlands 1 . loot scales to within a couple levels ; most drops will be level 49 or 50 . quest rewards scale to your level too ; this is why it is important not to start certain side quests until playthrough 2.5 , otherwise you will miss out on the highest level rewards . side quests scale to when you start the mission so do not take them too early , if you want a level 50 reward , wait until you have finished the main quest . of course if the reward is green , you can go ahead and do it because the reward is junk anyway . note , without the uvhm dlc that it is still important to cap out your level , not just get to playthrough 2.5 before getting rewards , but as of right now the max level without the uvhm dlc is still 50 , and it is hard not to be level 50 by the time you complete the second playthrough . ultimate vault hunter mode ( playthrough 3 ) as of a patch april 2013 , there is also now an ultimate vault hunter mode or playthrough 3 , which is scaled to your level and much harder . it is mostly explained in these patch notes and this explanation : ultimate vault hunter mode is unlocked for a character once they have completed the main story missions in true vault hunter mode and reached level 50 . unlike other playthroughs , ultimate vault hunter mode can be replayed multiple times with players able to reset their overall mission progress at any time from the main menu . no more tutorial missions -- characters in ultimate vault hunter mode begin in southern shelf with the " cleaning up the berg " mission . while playing in ultimate vault hunter mode , enemies and bosses will scale according to the player 's current level or , if playing with others , the highest-level player in that party . -gameplay changes in uvhm : enemy health generally increased 4x . enemies now have a moderate amount of health regeneration . increased duration of slag damage multiplier effect . upped the damage that slagged enemies take from 2x to 3x . weapon swap speed increased to better facilitate slag use . enemies now more likely to drop ammo . loot midgets are now " legendary loot midgets " that can drop legendary and other top-tier gear . powerful new “ancient” e-tech relics and rare pearlscent-grade weapons can be picked up in ultimate vault hunter mode . generally speaking , enemies are harder , have much more health , slag is much more effective , rare drops are increased and certain new e-tech relics and pearlescent ( cyan colored ) equips are avalible only in uvhm . the e-tech relics and pearlescents are only availible in uvhm for people with the ultimate vault hunter upgrade pack ( $5 dlc , included for free with the season pass ) . note that due to the increased difficulty and increased efficacy of slag , uvhm is particularly suited to co-op play . just like in " raid " boss fights , a siren with res is always useful . to my knowledge there is no " playthrough 3.5" since the " . 5" was always about enemies/loot that scale to your level . playthrough 3 scales from the start so there is no extra post-playthrough for scaling .
there is no best way to do it , as such . both steam and wine are ever-changing , and today 's best method might break tomorrow* . people have reported that steam works with just standard wine . install wine from the software center ( or click the shopping bag icon ) . right click the installer executable , go to properties → permissions and check allow executing file as program , then right click it again and select open with wine windows program loader . if it turns out that does not work for you , you can try using playonlinux . marco has detailed the instructions on how to get it working behind the link . if it still does not work , you can give crossover games a go . though it is number three on this list on purpose . in general , it seems that steam will work okay . you should try to run it using out-of-the-box wine first . if you run into any trouble , feel free to ask a question under the wine tag at ask ubuntu . also see this site for steam games that work with wine ( and , by extension , playonlinux ) . * note : if you get it to work , updates to wine will most probably never break it . but it may well be the steam people are fighting off wine compatibility . it may also be they are actively trying to make their program run well under wine ( games publishers have been known to do that ) .
you need an alias . create a file called autoexec . cfg in your steam\steamapps\your_alias_here\team fortress 2\tf\cfg and add the following : //Rocket Jump alias +rocketjump "+jump;+duck;wait;+attack" alias -rocketjump "-jump;-attack;wait;wait;wait;-duck" bind mouse2 "+rocketjump"  change mouse2 to your desired key . you can do so much with scripting , this is just one example . check out the tf2 wiki for more .
try out the bukkit plugin called terrain control . it features the ability to change the water height by modifying the config . however , you will have to run a bukkit server on your local network to use it . as of snapshot 14w17a , it is now possible to customize the water level ingame . when creating a new world , this can be achieved by clicking More World Options... , changing the World Type to Customized , and then selecting the Customize button . here , you can change the sea level by moving the slider that says Sea Level , as well as many more options .
once your multiplayer character reaches level 20 , you can choose to " promote " them . it is a bit comparable to the call of duty series ' " prestige " system , in that your multiplayer level for that class is then reset to 1 , and you level up again to repeat the process . promoting imports them into your single-player game as a " war asset " worth 75 points , which goes towards increasing your total military strength . in addition , playing the multiplayer maps will add to your galactic readiness multiplier . this functionality is what bioware designed in order to have multiplayer affect your single-player game . promoting also adds 10 to your n7 multiplayer rating .
in the are you kill the hydra in darkroot basin , where the golden golem was , you will find a portal to the new area . to reach this area you will need to kill a new , special crystal golem that appears in the first populated room of the duke 's archives , it will drop a broken pendant . with that pendant , and after killing the gollem and saving dusk of oolacile ( the lady that sells magic ) a portal will appear in the place the lady was . check the walkthrough of this page : http://darksouls.wikidot.com/sanctuary-garden
this is entirely situational . if their ad carry is out of place and you have the window to take him out then by all means do so . but if he is in the back you will just get yourself killed . i think this is common sense . you will have to stay disciplined and act if you have the window of opportunity . otherwise just dps the one who is in your range . prioritize squishies over tanks but if you only have a tank in range then hit him . some damage is better than no damage .
nephalem valor no longer exists in the game . you cannot farm it at all , no matter where you go .
the dark world in the link to the past is basically the reflection of ganon 's heart ( greed and evil ) when he claimed the triforce way back when . since lorule shared the same past as hyrule , except that the people became greedier and more evil , and wished upon their own triforce for their own greedy and evil wants , that lorule somehow became " like " the dark world , as it is the reflection of the residents ' dark and twisted hearts , paralleled with ganon 's evil and twisted heart .
minecraft does not use items.png anymore , since it has switched to using individual files for each item and block . ( if you are using tiled png images in your resourcepack , you should be aware that these are no longer the correct format . ) there are four textures for potions : potion_bottle_drinkable.png potion_bottle_empty.png potion_bottle_splash.png potion_overlay.png you can see these files by opening the minecraft jarfile ( in .minecraft\versions\1.6.4\1.6.4.jar ) using a utility like 7zip and navigating down into the assets\minecraft\textures\items\ folder inside the jar . your resource pack should have the same folder structure , as well as a pack.png file and a pack.mcmeta file at the top level .

you can zoom map files , but you have to do it by editing your nbt files . this answer is thanks to this redditor : if you are willing to dive deep into the nbt files , you can adjust the map 's center and zoom levels . just do not screw with dimension ( locks the map ) or width/height &mdash ; it does not work . the files are under &lt;map-name&gt;/Data/map_X.dat , where x is the map number . you will need to use an editor like nbtedit to edit the files .
to be able to perform a double assassination , you have to be in high profile . low profile kills will generally allow you to kill a single target . it is not automatic like it was in previous games . but it ultimately depends on the weapons used . but in the end , it all depends on if two enemies are highlighted and not just one . with the ( double ) hidden blade equipped , when two enemies are close to each other and you are in range of both of them , you must enter high profile and assassinate them . if you are on a higher elevation , it will almost always do a double aerial assassination . if you are carrying a ( loaded ) rifle , you can kill two enemies if they are lined up one behind the other . it does not matter if you stay in high or low profile for this , you will be firing a shot and that is always a high profile move . i do not believe there are other weapons that can kill multiple enemies in a single attack .
how do you play a region-locked xbox 360 game ? you can play a region-locked xbox 360 game on a console for that region as you have already figured out . the three regions are generally identified by the different output standards that they support in those regions of ntsc , ntsc-j , and pal . can an xbox account in the us region exist on a foreign console ? this seems to be your real question . you should consider changing the title . the short answer is yes . also to address what seems to be your primary concern , achievements that you earn on your foreign console can be added to your gamertag , regardless of what region it is from . see this thread about stacking achievements . the relevant post is as follows : . . . so if i buy a pal360 ( which is europe ) and get a copy of german bioshock . all i need to do is attach my harddrive to the pal360 and get more achievements for playing the same game , hence stackable . is this correct ? yes , but for the convenience of use you can simple store your profile in a memory unit and use it between 2 consoles , each one with its hdd . you have to log with you normal account every time you play the games in different consoles , to earn the achievements . so , simply put , you just copy your profile over to the other console either using an hdd or memory stick and sign in as normal . with the advent of the ability to have a cloud save of your profile , it may be possible to copy your profile over by simply using the internet , but i have not read anything to confirm this yet .

in dark souls 2 you can consider infusions and the +n upgrades as two separate properties of the weapon . for example , if you have a +10 claymore and infuse it with lightning , you will have a +10 lightning claymore . further , you can " uninfuse " it and it'll go back to just a +10 claymore . there is no upgrading of the infusions themselves . that said , if you infuse a less than +10 weapon , you can still continue upgrading it to +10 with titanite , and it will retain its infusion as you upgrade it . whether or not to infuse a weapon is another question . each infusion does something different to the weapon . something like lightning will take away some of the base damage on the weapon and replace it with lightning damage . this also affects the scaling . a purely strength based character probably would not want to infuse with lightning , since doing so would likely lower the scaling off of strength and add scaling for lightning ( which is affected by faith ) . a strength/faith hybrid build might do a lightning infusion , though . there is so many combinations , and each type of infusion works differently ( raw increases base damage but lowers scaling , mundane adds scaling based on your lowest stat , etc ) . my best advice would be to experiment with different types , as there is not necessarily a " right " answer ( keep in mind that you can preview the changes before you actually go ahead with the infusion ) . it depends a ton on your build and playstyle .
there is nothing built in within windows to achieve what you want , but it is certainly possible . external applications can aid you with this . an example is mouse speed switcher . autohotkey is also viable if you had like to program that yourself .

what is happening is you are suffocating - your head is buried into a block of stone . try and move out of the way ; if that does not work equip a pickaxe and mine yourself a 1×1×2 bubble directly ahead of you , then move into it . buy yourself some extra time by switching to peaceful difficulty .
from what i can see , the three skill branches seem to favour different approaches to combat . in addition to the extra types of attacks you gain for each weapon type ( e . g . , chop for axes , bash for maces , slash for swords ) , you get increases to different attributes at different skill levels , which will allow you to hone your fighter as you want : axes give increases to strength and health maces give increases to vitality and health swords give increases to strength , health , energy and dexterity ( each to a necessarily lesser degree than the other weapon skills ) so in essence , if you want a pure brute , unstoppable in close combat , axes may be a good choice . if you want more of a tank build - to be able to withstand more attacks - go for maces , as the increased vitality will let you level up your health even faster . swords seem to be the all-rounder , with a mix of upped combat strength as well as accuracy and energy . source : just the descriptions of the skills in the game menu .
i just reloaded my game about 10 times trying to figure this out and i have some results . i tested the same 5 colonels , randomly mixing them together in testing , every single one of them was psi gifted , but not every time . it is not determined when the character is created , the fact that the colonel with the lowest will became gifted but only once out of the 10 times points to randomly gifting the soldiers being tested but adding their will score to the roll . simply put , if you want your favorite characters to all be psychics it is easy , it will just take a long time , you will have to put them through testing by themselves or with rookies added in and keep reloading until they become psychic then work on the next character . i have gotten 2 out of the 3 as gifted in about half of the 10 tests , but i was not able to garner a 3 for 3 .
there is no possibility to mute a specific player . you will have to turn voice off altogether : (
class specific weapons can provide some class only enchantments that you cannot get on standard weapons . whether or not this is worth a trade off for damage , that is entirely up to you to decide . for instance , you can find a demon hunter only 1 handed crossbow that provides hatred regeneration or a wand for mages that provides improved arcane pool . like james mentioned in his answer , the demon hunter is the only class that has a unique situation where you must have a ranged weapon equipped or you can not use his ranged attack skills . and his one handed crossbow is the only ranged weapon you can dual wield .
leaving aside the issue of varying resistances that you will encounter : as a rule of thumb , fire spells will do the most damage , including a chance to cause enemies to catch fire and continue to take damage for a few seconds . frost spells drain opponents stamina , and slow their movement . shock spells drain magicka , and can chain to other , nearby opponents . in addition , there are several perks specific to each damage type . above and beyond the pure damage increase perks , the disintegrate , deep freeze , and intense flames perks add a chance for an additional effect when casting shock , frost , or fire spells on a target , respectively .

/summon squid ~ ~ ~ {riding:{id:"bat"} , invulnerable:1} this summons an invincible squid riding a bat . the invincibility means the squid can not airdrown but the bat can still be killed . if you want it to never despawn : /summon squid ~ ~ ~ {riding:{id:"bat"} , invulnerable:1 , persistencerequired:1} to name it derp , you had need : /summon squid ~ ~ ~ {riding:{id:"bat"} , invulnerable:1 , customname:"derp " , persistencerequired:1 , customnamevisible:1} this is too long for the chat box however and it might be simpler just to spawn a nametag and use that . update : i took some info from the other answers and made this : /summon squid ~ ~ ~ {riding:{id:"bat " , invulnerable:1 , persistencerequired:1 , activeeffects : [ {id:14 , amplifier:-10 , duration:2147483648} ] } , invulnerable:1 , customname:"derp " , persistencerequired:1 , customnamevisible:1} persistent invincible squid named derp riding a persistent invisible invincible bat . fly my pretties , fly !
i was wandering around arqade meta and found this : this is currently the case for starcraft 2 hots . everybody can preorder on amazon and get a free beta key .
those offers typically have an expiration date , though it may be in small print . there are a couple possibilities : blizzard offered 7 free days back in november in preparation for the cataclysm release . not sure why it would appear this late on your account , but it could just have been an error . i vaguely recall receiving a couple " come back to us " kind of offers on my second ( now expired : ) ) account . it is possible that you received one of those and it also expired . to be certain , i would contact blizzard 's support and see what they say .
there are a few differences that are known and probably more as well : higher difficulties mean higher tier loot . jay wilson stated that over 70% of all of the armor items in the game cannot even be found in normal difficulty . so as the difficulty raises so do the armor tiers . one can assume 4 per act totaling 16 tiers . remember , tiers do not necessarily mean better , just different looking . as the difficulty increases , the boss monsters become more powerful . more specifically , in each difficulty , the monsters gain one more special ability . by inferno , they can have up to 4 special attributes which can make them very difficult to take down . more obviously , the standard enemies will scale with the difficulty . this video says that monsters scale much like they do in diablo 2 . they all have set stats which they carry with them as they level . the monsters also have more awareness and abilities as they scale through the difficulties . also , you progress through the difficulties , you can upgrade your artisans more through items that drop only in higher difficulties . however , as noted by @kexlox you can also buy the tomes from the ah and upgrade your artisans early . keep in mind while playing that normal is made to basically be the tutorial and break you into the game . experienced d2 players will cut through normal with ease . as you progress , the game does get very difficult , and you will be wearing your butt on your head once you reach inferno . inferno was basically built to murder you . jay wilson stated that they took the hardest difficulty that their testers could handle and agreed was fair and they doubled it . from brysonic 's answer - the difficulty also scales by having additional players affect monster hp . monster damage used to scale , but no longer does as of patch 1.0.3 . note : because of patch 1.04 monster health per additional player now is not effected by difficulty . here is a table showing the amount of scaling that occurs based on the number of players in the game : this table is now technically useless , but i will leave it here as a placeholder .
you can not sell things . they are worthless to you .
yes , it is condition 70% , according to this : http://web.archive.org/web/20120603154301/http://www.dead-island.com/forums/dead-island-tips-tricks-guides/4266-optimal-repair-cost.html . the repair cost does not increase by a static amount for every hit . the repair cost seems to be about 3.6644 times the default value of the weapon when durability is depleted . the increase in repair cost per hit follows an inverted parabolic curve . the durability is , in most cases , one less than the number of hits a weapon can inflict before breaking . there seems to be a base repair cost which is about 33% of the value , thereby making the first hit always the most expensive . summary : the optimal repair point is 70% durability . the cost per hit is most expensive at 40% durability .

sony allows to have people in other platforms to interact with their players but ms do not . one of the recent cases in last year that explained that to the user was square enix , regarding questions of why not having final fantasy xiv on xbox . their answer was that since microsoft has an strict policy concerning online servers , the xbox users would had to have their own private server , with no possibility of people transferring from/to and therefore se gave up on the idea of porting to xbox . check the ign interview with se 's naoki yoshida for more info on this example : " the policy has not changed on microsoft 's side , " he revealed . " the main reason from our side is that i do not want the community to be divided ; to be split into two or more . for example , one player might be on the pc version , another might be on the ps4 version , and i am playing the xbox version - but we are not able to join the same game servers . that is just . . . i just do not like the idea . i disagree with it .

according to the readme on autolabor , it automagically does that stuff for you . i can see that it may be trying to diversify the work pool or maybe those dwarvs were just nearer to objectives . this is however the risk you take when using an optimization tool out of the box ( the risk being that results may vary amongst users ) . anyway , the readme also states a good way to prevent autolabor kicking in , which is to burrow dwarves . it also recommends to check help autolabor for extended usage , to which i am pasting the output here . with some customization , it is possible to configure autolabor to restrict labors to a certain quantity of dwarves or to disable it for certain labors . the labor tokens seem to be those used by the game , which are available at the wiki . i personally use dwarftherapist to assign labors , as i like to control which specific dwarves do which labors .

there is no way to avoid having a username in minecraft pe .
from my experience , whenever i melee an opponent who does not have any shields , the melee always kills them . if you melee when they still have shields , then only their shields are removed ( thus taking a max of two melee attacks to kill an opponent ) . edit : the bungie weekly update for september 24 has more information about how melee attacks and headshots work in halo reach . the basic idea is the same : melee will destroy any remaining shields ( and nothing else ) , while a melee to a shieldless opponent will kill him .
if the black knight sword was wielded in a two-handed fashion , the strength requirement is lowered to 14 . with the dexterity requirement being 18 , it is possible for a pyromancer to have this equipment set at level 12 . however , if you are the one invading , you can invade players of any level . while the dark souls system attempts to match you with players that are around your level , you will eventually work your way up to high-level players if there is no-one else around .
play the other races . sure , you might be able to advance your score faster by focusing on one build , but you are also a lot more likely to become bored . at the bronze level , the most important lessons you can learn are transferable between races , like building workers ( build a lot , and keep building ) , building buildings , expanding , and keeping pressure up . if you feel that this is too hard , or playing all 3 races is too much , then i recommend you focus on either the zerg or protoss and terran . z plays very differently from p/t and you might run into frustration if you try to play z the same way as you play p/t .
pc players can use the console to allow more than one follower at a time . after obtaining a follower , the playerfollowercount global varable is set to 1 . setting it back to 0 will enable you to obtain another follower . to set playerfollowercount to zero , open the console ( default ~ ) , type in set PlayerFollowerCount to 0 , hit enter , then close the console ~ .
no , starcraft ii itself cannot remember your battle .netpassword . however , you can use keyboard macros or macro/hotkey programs to enter it for you . people ( including myself ) have been using scripts to automatically launch , enter passwords , and log into various blizzard games . this is not a violation of blizzard 's terms of use , because it does not affect the actual game . it is only illegal if your macro/hotkey scripts are actually performing actions within the game itself . if you are looking for some tools to automate the launch process , you can look into autohotkey or hotkeynet . to be more exact , follow the one action , one keystroke rule . which means that any character action or ui input must be the immediate result of a human pressing a key . so while i can have a single key macro to press multiple hotkeys simultaneously , it would be illegal to make it so that when i press a button , keystrokes would be sent to the game client 5 seconds later . any sort of " wait " action in your macros are against the tou . as a multiboxer , i can personally affirm that it is fine to have me press '1' on my keyboard and have all 5 of my shamans cast lightning bolt . it is not fine for me to have a macro that sends ' d ' ( unload ) on a nydus network every 20 seconds for remote drone mining .
the game is not , in specific , harder in mercenary mode . however , two things may be causing your apparent increase in difficulty : as you generate more chaos overall in the process of unlocking the story missions , you increase your maximum heat level . this can lead to a much more rapid and strong response from the panuan military . when you venture into new areas , you may be in zones where you have not damaged the panuan infrastructure as much . taking out enemy communications arrays , air fields , and military leaders can make a noticeable difference in the enemy 's response time .

in the general case , the best way to work it out is get a separate , blank installation and add the mod you want to remove . see what the side-effects are ( what files are created ) when you add that mod . then go to your proper installation and remove those files .
no , currently there is no way to hide the sold/expired listings . sometimes i actually find them helpful because i know for sure that something similar at the price they were listed at will sell . i do this by altering my max buyout price until i have a rough idea of what the buyout of the sold item was .
from the dwarf fortress wiki : framerate is used in dwarf fortress to measure the speed at which the game is running . to check your fps ( frames per second ) in dwarf fortress , simply change [ fps:no ] to [ fps:yes ] in init . txt , and your fps will be displayed near the top right corner of the screen .
since you can only build on terrain owned by your own nation , the question is how to get new terrain . you can build a fort pressing f . then , the fort , and ( sometimes ) some terrain around it , will be set to your country . i think taking over a foreign fort has even the same effect . this new terrain is suited to build you city . i found this out by chance . the official handbook , freeciv . wikia . com , does not mention this , though . it might be a bug , but it is perfectly working .
as of minecraft 1.3.1 , which brought about server commands , weather is able to be toggled on and off via the following conmmand : toggledownfall | toggles rain and snow . to run commands ( by enabling cheat mode upon map creation ) : commands being entered into the minecraft client itself must be prefixed by a slash ( example : /me flips a table ) . the command window is identical to the chat window and can be accessed by pressing t or starting directly by entering a slash . commands being executed via the console are not preceded by a slash . otherwise , if you do not have cheats mode enabled , you can sleep in beds ( only at night ! ) to skip weather . also , if you are playing on survival , and you have the perfect opportunity for a screenshot , but no cheats mode , a quick tip is to " open to lan " your game ( hit esc , click open to lan ) , and enable " cheats mode : on " . then , toggle the weather off , and screenshot away !
gaining ap does not benefit someone who is already l8 , but they do continue to gain ap - although it will not be reflected in the octagonal progress bar , since there is no progress towards l9 . i have heard of l8 players who had enough ap ( 2.4mil+ ) to become l9 if that existed : ) the factor of taking potential ap away from team mates is definitely a valid concern though , as an l8 its better to just help in bombing runs and let lower levels finish off portals and fields for ap whenever possible .

before the shaman got pulled down by the tentacle , he mentioned that thrall must be informed of the event . i thought naturally i have to return to orgrimmar to find him . i went back to the horde ship in shimmering expanse where an npc is there to give me a quest to report back to orgrimmar .
yes it has been done by a team of 2:
the number of mods skyrim can handle seems to be limited by an unsigned byte , meaning slightly less than ~256 mods . ( this account says 252 accounting for skyrim . esm , the update . esm , and the saved game ) if you need more , some tools such as wrye bash can combine mods together , but this means you will need to manage these mods outside of steam workshop ( nexus mod manager is a good option ) . previously there was a 50 mod subscription bug with steam workshop , but it looks like update 1.4.27 fixed that issue .
blue shields in the city view correspond to the production value of the city , they do not have anything to do with soldiers . this corresponds to how quickly the city can produce units and buildings . soldiers have separate shields that show their allegiance ( by colour ) and their health ( by amount filled ) .
a few disadvantages : it has less overall cloak time than the invisibility watch if you are running ( 6.6s vs . 9s ) . you cannot use ammo boxes or dropped weapons to recharge your cloak ; whereas with the invisibility watch you can extend your cloak time ( or recharge faster ) using these items .
summarized results : happiness is calculated based on individual player 's difficulty . bonus vs . barbarians uses the lowest player 's difficulty the ai starts use the lowest player 's difficulty . rewards from ruins are either based on individual player difficulty or lowest player 's difficulty culture costs are based on individual player difficulty . not sure on city state bonuses , will probably test those tonight . i assume they will use the lowest player 's difficulty . not sure on ai skill , i assume they will use the lower player 's difficulty . i probably will not be able to test this due to the length of civilization games . onto the proof , first the two testing parameters : vs . happiness works as expected : i have a starting happiness of 6 after my first city on deity . cartecs has a happiness of 15 on settler . vs . i have a happiness of 15 on settler difficulty with cartec 's playing on deity . interestingly , it looks like it uses the lowest player 's difficulty for barbarian fights : i am playing on deity difficulty here with a settler difficulty human in the game : vs . i am playing on settler difficulty here with a deity difficulty human in the game : vs . lone human at deity difficulty : ai starts : turn 9 in both cases : playing on settler with another human on deity results in computer 's using settler starts : vs . this is a game with just me playing on deity difficulty . i saw further proof in both games . while playing the multiplayer japan managed one city by turn ~14 . in the deity game alone , egypt managed two cities and multiple warriors . this is consistent with settler vs . deity starts . as a settler difficulty player i was able to find settlers in ruins , and get a lot more upgrades quickly . as a deity player i did not notice a particular increase in ruin rewards . this does not really prove much beyond the fact it either uses the lowest difficulty bonus or uses the individual bonuses . as a settler player it cost 10 culture to get the first policy . as the deity player it cost 25 culture to get the first policy . you can see this in the happiness screenshots .
you can check an option under multiplayer -> advanced to " remember last weapon between lives " . that should make it easier to keep " q " rotating between your preferred weapons -- you will only have to swap between them once , when you first spawn as that class .
without any upgrades or anything , a golden cookie spawns m minutes after the last one disappeared , where m is a random number between 5 and 15 . each of the upgrades lucky day and serendipity cut that time in half , and the debug upgrade gold hoard makes them spawn pretty much constantly instead . also , if your last cookie gave you a cookie chain , then the next one spawns 3 seconds later . this means that you are not more likely to get a golden cookie if you have not clicked on one in a while . without any upgrades , again , a golden cookie lasts for 13 seconds before disappearing . the lucky day and serendipity upgrades both double that . if your last cookie gave you a cookie chain , then it disappears after 6 seconds instead . when you get what appears to be a flat number of cookies , it either gives you 10% of your cookies or the equivalent of 20 minutes of cookie production , whichever is lower . the bonus you get is randomly chosen each time you click the cookie . it normally chooses between frenzy , which multiplies your production by 7 , and lucky , which gives you cookies as i just described . there is also a small chance of getting a click frenzy , which multiplies your cookies per click by 777 , and an even smaller chance of getting a cookie chain , which gives you 6 the first time you get it , 66 the second time , etc . until you get something else . as michael madsen 's answer points out , the effects appear to alternate because every time you click a golden cookie , there is an 80% chance that it will remove the previous effect from the list of possible effects before it picks which one actually happens . once the grandmapocalypse begins , you also have a chance of getting ruin , which makes you lose half as many cookies as you would gain from a lucky cookie , clot , which cuts your production in half , and elder frenzy , which multiplies your production by 666 for a few seconds .
passive mob spawning has changed in version 1.8 . animals now spawn when a new chunk is generated and they do not despawn . however , there seem to be some disagreement as to what happens if you kill all the animals around you . some say that they do not respawn while others claim that they do but do so very slowly . the best thread i have seen about this is this one posted mere hours ago . it seems to confirm what you see , that animals do not respawn at all . update : the same thread now seems to confirm that they do respawn , just very slowly . also , i think everyone agree that animals do not spawn in ocean biomes at all . i have played on a couple of islands far out to sea myself and have never seen animals there . in version 1.9 breeding of animals will be introduced . hopefully that will clear things up .
krogan are only unlocked as rare items , which means that your best bet is opening spectre packs ( because they guarantee a rare ) . it is possible to get them in veteran packs , but tends to be less likely . i do not think there is good data yet on what the % chance of a rare rolling for recruit and veteran packs are , so i guess it comes down to : " does this one consider itself fortunate ? " because you are effectively gambling either way - and especially since there is no guarantee you will get a character at all ( you could also get weapons or a respec kit ) .
when you collect all of the feathers your mother will give you the auditore cape ! . . . that is the only thing that happens . nothing else happens when you complete a 100% synced . what ezio 's sister may refer to is a trauma from what happened to her .
the dragonborn is ambidexterous , but refuses to wield a shield in their right hand . magic and weapons can be used in any combination of right / left , left / right , etc . the dual-wield " penalty " as it were , is that you cannot block when dual-wielding . ( even though you could normally block with a single weapon if your offhand is free . )
you can get crystals from both hyperius and master gee the invincible . both of these fights are more tactical than complicated , and can be really difficult to do without an experienced team . both of these bosses have quests that lead to them , after you beat the main story for the dlc . each boss drops ~10 crystals each . this is painstakingly low , as a weapon in the seraph vendor will cost you 120 shard , where as the relic ( always the item of the day ) will cost you 50 crystals . the relic is an upgraded version of the blood of terramorphous , giving both health regen and increased max health . the weapons are , stat-wise , pretty useless for the price , but can be a ( slight ) upgrade to the weapons you may have now . every one of the pink " seraph " items have a red text , including the relic and shield . as of yet , nobody has figured out what the red effects are . note that , since a recent update , you will have to defeat these bosses on true vault hunter mode to get crystals . they will be easier but will not drop crystals in normal mode . voracidous the invincible from the sir hammerlock 's big game hunt dlc and the ancient dragons of destruction from the tiny tina 's assault on dragon keep dlc also have a chance of dropping crystals upon defeating them .
this is because of a feature being removed from the decal tool in the 17/10/11 patch : it is worth noting that with the removal of the painterly effect you can no longer create full colored decals and are instead limited to a maximum of five or so colors . items that had a decal applied before the painterly effect was removed still retain their original color . the full-colour ones you see must have been decaled before the full-colour feature was removed . however , there remains a way to do it manually , shown by this video . it involves downloading a folder with two files in it ( one for flair , the other for . . . i guess the sign ) ; according to the description said files are available here or here and apparently designed for some form of photoshop ( the gimp is probably capable of dealing with it ) . edit the template files ( you may have to save as new and then overwrite ) and use them as your decal .
not only do most bosses respawn , even the final boss respawns . however , the boss listed in the " midgame spoiler " section below is replaced by a similar , new boss . and the second-to-last boss is the only other boss that does not respawn . every other boss respawns 100% of the time . midgame spoiler : bloodwing does not respawn , but son of mothrakk spawns in her place , the fight is similar but he does not change elements and is generally much easier . presumably he drops similar items . final battle spoiler : handsome jack does not respawn , but the warrior does . seems you have one chance per playthrough to get jack 's mask for this reason . you also will not get the generic loot that jack would have dropped if you fight warrior again , but warrior drops plenty on his own if you get two jack 's masks , keep one for a friend . any boss that drops unique loot respawns — except for the final battle ( see the spoiler part above ) , but that boss can only possibly drop one unique item anyway : a specific skin customization .
there is no way . microsoft made it so the play and charge kit only receives power . i believe there is some other data that is sent to the controller as well that someone decoded but there is no data sent to the computer from the controller . i will try to dig up a link . on the other hand , you could just buy a wired controller , those are about as expensive as the wireless receiver , work on both pc and xbox/xbox360 , and you had have an extra controller for a friend .
you do not gain experience from kills in skyrim . whenever you use a skill in a meaningful manner , you gain a little bit of experience in that skill . gain enough experience and that skill levels up , giving you experience towards your next level . having a companion may make leveling slower solely through the fact that they take the kills and you have less opportunity to exercise your skills , but their kills do not attribute anything to you at all .
there is another mention in an update to the alliance engineering corps war asset : update the last reports from the aec were little more than officers screaming about rachni flooding into their barracks , scything through unsuspecting scientists . after a brave , but brief , battle , the core of the alliance engineering corps was wiped out by their traitorous alien " allies . " this also results in a -100 penalty for that war asset .
this normally happens when the pci bus is overclocked and your sound device is a realtek onboard chip . i think the slightly faster pci clock is causing the on-board sound timer to run fast , so if you have a 3% overclock , and are playing a 30 second clip , it will cut off one second sooner . the sad part is that many motherboards come with an automatic small overclock to make them faster than their competitors , so even if you do not think you are overclocking your motherboard , you may be . if you know how to , go into your bios and try removing any fsb or pci overclocking and see if that fixes the issue . if you do not know what those acronyms are however , do not try it !
keep moving . sprint away , jump on a ledge , go behind pillars , chairs , tables . let your magicka regenerate , turn around and do some more damage to the enemy , sprint away , and whittle em down . also try and use traps that are in the dungeon on enemies , not only will they inflict damage on you but others as well . i recommend taking the horse carriage to the mages college at winterhold , so you can get some good magic gear and improved spells .
the weapons are similar but slight differences exist between some of the pairs . for instance , the carbine is strictly single-shot , while the burstgun fires a 3-round burst ( with annoying recoil ) ; the heater has a more limited range than the shotgun but does more damage and ignites , and the hail fire allows you to bounce grenades around corners as well as airburst them , neither of which you can do with the volley gun . the repeaters are essentially trade-off weapons , exchanging slower rate of fire for magazine size and more controllable recoil . so i guess the answer is that there are not strictly codified differences between the weapons - some handle quite differently , some can be seen as basic trade-offs . more here : http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/bioshock_infinite_weapons
as soon as you leave the station , turn left ( do not go into the ditch ) , there is a dead body there from which you can collect some filters . i found this info in this thread
a pick made of iron will mine all ores . a wood or stone pick will only mine coal , iron , and lapis ; but will destroy gold , diamond , redstone and emerald without dropping the item . the diamond pickaxe is the only pickaxe to get obsidian .
you may be able to recover it using some of the techniques that are used when the files go missing in power outages . all credit goes to the origional poster , this is located on the minecraft offical forums . i am unsure if this works for upgrade losses but id imagine the backup would still be there unless you have played to the point it recreated ? you may be able to check %appdata% . minecraft\saves and see if your world still exists on that side for the recovery attempt . tutorial : how to restore missing world after system crash http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=17t=51286 wish i could be more specific , reply here if you need help or have any concerns .
no , they only affect turret-based weapons . missiles are unaffected . there were some plans by ccp to change this at some point , but they were not actually implemented . i have not heard about them in a while so i am not sure if they are still planning to change this .
there are no " sell orders " in world of warcraft , however you can put your own item up for auction by using the " auction " tab with the auction house window open . if you want other players to buy out your item right away , set a " buyout " price . the " starting " price is mandatory , but can be set to the same value as the buyout price to discourage bidding .
you will only get experience the first time you pick up a specific book . any time after , you will only get gold , even if that book was in a different location . if it is the first time picking up the book , you will hear the dialog , even if you are playing with others .
all intensity stacking effects ( might , bleeding , confusion , and vulnerability ) stack to a max of 25 times . each stack has it is own internal duration . all duration stacking effects ( fury , protection , regeneration , retaliation , swiftness , vigor , burning , chilled , crippled , immobilized , poison , weakness , stability ) seem to have a max time limit of 22-24 hours . ( the guardian virtue of courage passive provides a 24 hour aegis when it ticks . ) the entire duration has the intensity of the best intensity applied to the stack . quickness is not a boon , but instances of quickness do stack duration with each other as well .
the reaper of souls update has substantially modified this process . there are 4 different machines that can be created which correspond to the particular fights to obtain a particular organ . no more opening 3 portals to guarantee seeing the uber you need . act 1: fields of misery : odeg - the key of bones act 2: dahlgur oasis : sokahr - the key of gluttony act 3: stonefort : xah'rith - the key of war act 4: silver spire level one : nekarat - the key of evil the infernal machine plan can drop from any of the keywardens and they all have a small chance to spawn a second key that is not particular to them . to craft one of the 4 machines you only require the appropriate key and 100,000 gold coins . the level 70 hellfire ring requires 4 organs , the new crafting plan which costs 5,000,000 gold coins from squirt in act 2 and 50,000 coins to craft . the organs are : vial of putridness ( infernal machine of gluttony ) leoric 's regret ( infernal machine of bones ) idol of terror ( infernal machine of war ) heart of evil ( infernal machine of evil ) it is still possible to obtain the original keys while you are level 60 and to craft the level 60 hellfire ring as per the legacy information that used to be contained in answers here ( you can see that info from reviewing edits on the top answers ) . it is not possible to stack the level 60 and 70 hellfire rings to obtain an 80% experience gain bonus . it is not confirmed that the organs drop with the same rate as the keys . they pop only in torment difficulties . the rates are listed in this answer .
many of the settings can be changed manually if you know what you are doing in the game files , but unfortunately a lot of these are not supported to be changed from anywhere except from within a game . in fact , some of them are not even supported in there , and must be changed manually ! the official wiki has a multitude of examples listed here you can always start a custom game with no penalty for leaving , and without requiring other people to be in game . you may choose to add bots as well to mess around with settings that may depend on seeing enemies and teammates ( such as the side indicators for teammates , and the tab overview screen ) . note that custom is different than co-op vs . ai .
the outcomes are the same : if you give her the eggs , she will sleep with you . having played as a female character ( with black widow ) , i was a little dissapointed that the perk did not give any additional dialog options . my guess is that they did not want to focus on this too much for fear of a whole hot coffee debacle .
the essence lies in how to handle " large groups " , you need to look at the advantages you have : sentries : these early units allow you to split up or trap an army by using force fields , reduce incoming range damage using their guardian shield and allow you to create hallucinated units which will take damage aways from your real units . colossus : there mid game units are known for their aoe damage , they will quickly fry a bio ball . watch out for air though , although stalkers are useful against air to some extent . . . :- ) high templar : these mid to late game unit is also known for their powerful storms , they also have feedback to drain energy from units and can warp in more powerful archons . . . carriers : these late games units have interceptors that work for them so they can stay at a safe distance and thus result in devastating damage if your enemy does not manage to take them , supported by an army it can be tricky for your opponent to handle you . check the macro of one of your replays that is related to your question , you might be able to find an economy or production gap that makes it clear why you got outnumbered . check if you expanded well ( at 2 workers / min patch ) , check if you resources were too high ( not enough gateways ) , and so on . . .
you have if i remember correctly 2 solutions : learn the skill to levitate ennemies and use it to throw them away . as in the first trine , create an object and let it fall on your ennemies from a good height . ( you can use environnement items such as rocks aswell )
if you start the mission " trailing the coven " and leave new tristram heading towards old tristram , you can find rumford 's corpse on a bridge not far from the town gates . clicking on him will make your character deliver a short eulogy ( in my witch doctor 's case , he said " rest easy , friend . . . " ) . there is no in-game dialog that explains exactly how he died , but given the events of the mission prior , it is likely he was slain : while trying to protect the town from the cultists who kill deckard cain and take tyrael 's sword fragments .
i could not use the patch , and i was not stealthy enough , so i tried sheathing the weapon . it turns out that you can not just turn up with your weapon sheathed - they still attack , and you need to send your followers away , or else they get involved and a fight occurs . so what you need to do is arrive alone with your weapon out , and when you are attacked , immediately sheath the weapon . then you are arrested and sent to cedhna - which gives you that mission .
i have seen citizens get " dropped off " at work ( most notably construction workers ) , so you would want roads that leads from where your citizens lives to the areas where they are most likely to visit to cut down on time . however , when its time to go home , they will not get picked up and has to walk to the nearest garage for transportation . as you build your road network , try to keep congestion low as i have also seen huge traffic backups in major areas which i am sure lowers productivity . you would not want your minions to spend more time in traffic and less time in the sweat shops , after all . also , each garage seems to be able to support 150ish cars , if there are higher demands than that you will receive a message that says the garage is overloaded . try to plan ahead so there is not just one garage servicing your " downtown " area , for example .
smart casting does not mean " it'll cast stuff for you " . smart casting means " when you hit the hotkey , it immediately casts the spell as if you were targetting where your mouse cursor is hovering " . when you hover over a unit , the colored border around it will thicken . this will denote exactly which unit you will smart-cast against when using a targetted skill ( like rammus ' puncturing taunt ) , provided it is a valid target . when using an area-of-effect or skillshot skill , then a smart-cast will be targetted as if you had clicked whereever the mouse is currently situation . it saves you not merely time in setting up the launch , but also gives you much more flexibility in the actual gameplay . using normal targetting practices , you have to either select your target or cancel the skill , you cannot input any other commands . with smart-casting , you can focus on the setup for your skill , and then adapt your movements to any updates in the situation without needing to cancel out . and then once you get in position , it is just one button click to fire . since it can be thrown out from any action as fast as you can drag your mouse over , it can be a lot faster and catch your opponent off-guard , especially for otherwise predictable lead-in skills . its utility in being smartly used is entirely dependent on how effective you can utilize aiming without the guide ranges provided for skills . for targetted effects , it rather depends on your ability to target by hovering on a unit rather than clicking on a unit ( so in clusters , it is important for knowing the timing so that you do not cast on the wrong foe ) . it offers speed , but unless your accuracy is up to par , it may be more effective to stick with normal casting for skills until you get the hang of it .
a number of items are unlocked via the story when new types of heists are made available ( most of your loot items are gotten this way ) but for new types of rooms and utility objects , you will need to do research . research automatically becomes available via the storyline -- you will get a possible heist to steal a highly advanced research machine , then need to fool the agents into stealing a fake research machine back , and acquire several experimenting devices ( three of six possible ; you get new opportunities for the remainder later ) . ( those experimenting devices also make for hilarious agent torturing methods , btw . be sure to put them through their paces from time to time . : ) ) once you have the research machine and the experimentation devices , make sure you have idle scientists of various types . they will meander around your base looking at stuff you have built , then poke their ideas into the research machine until research combinations pop out that you can tell them to start working on . a while later , a new design will pop out . a full list of what combinations result in what can be found here .
according to this guide ( see " section 9: dragoon level" ) :
the short version : it is all explained in the shattering , a novel released recently in the leadup to cataclysms release . wowinsider did those of us not inclined to read the warcraft novels a favor by providing by-character synopses of the novel . here 's the rundown on thralls story and why he abdicated , and here 's the meat on garrosh 's early days as thralls chosen successor , and the somewhat rocky first few months as warchief . the really short version : thrall left azeroth on a pilgrimage to draenor when the cataclysm was approaching to investigate stirrings among the elementals - garrosh , as his second , was named ' acting warchief ' in thralls absence . in the aftermath of deathwings return , thrall has applied his efforts primarily to working with the earthen ring and the council of tirsifal to eliminate the threats of the twilights hammer , deathwing , and hordes of extremely angry elementals after the cataclysm . meanwhile , in the wake of the razing of ogrimmnar and the elemental invasion , garrosh , already a war hero from the campaign in northrend , has become even more popular with the orcs of the horde , as well as the tauren , now led by baine bloodhoof , cementing his power .
i have tested this personally , it is for every 10 errands and bounty hunts you complete . do note that the count for errands and bounties are maintained seperately and the bonus merit point is awarded for completing 10 errands or 10 bounty hunts .
ping is the amount of milliseconds it takes a packet of information to reach the server from you and back . basically it is a measurement of connection speed , and it influences lag quite a lot . according to pingtest .net: [ ping ] tells how long it takes a " packet " of data to travel from your computer to a server on the internet and back . whenever you experience delayed responses in internet applications - this would be due to a higher than desired ping . similar to packet loss , lower is better when it comes to ping . a result below 100 ms should be expected from any decent broadband connection .
attackers can only steal a fraction of the defender 's resources . also , this amount changes depending on the town hall levels of the attacker and defender . see the wiki for exact percentages and more info .
there are : 3 for purchase from the candy merchant . 3 in the empty house in plain view . 1 in the empty house , hidden under the rug . 1 in the forge . 1 in the sorceress 's hut . 3 from answering the squirrel 's questions . making a total of 12 .

it seems that some enemies are tied to some missions , while others will appear anyway , but it seems that if you are quick enough they will appear earlier after certain missions . credit to yx and sterno in the comments below ! enemies which are tied to missions outsiders - first appear in a downed ufo . one appears in most ( but not all ) ufos after that . sectoid commanders - first appears during the assault on the alien base . after this point , sectoid commanders appear on the bridge of alien ufos , replacing the outsider . after the overseer ship mission is complete , they are replaced by ethereals . sectoid commanders may also appear on harder alien abduction missions , usually in small groups . source ethereals - first appear in the assault purple ufo mission , and then randomly in missions afterwards enemies which will appear anyway sectoids floaters and heavy floaters mutons and elite mutons berserkers sectopods thin men spartacus mentioned that chrysalids may be tied to the first terror mission .
if you own breezehome , she should be there . otherwise she should be in dragonreach ( the keep in whiterun ) , so you might just be dealing with a glitch .
you get the dagger on the last part of quest arniel 's endeavor but you have to deliver it to arniel gane at the end of a quest . he should immediately use the dagger for some magic and he will " explode , " dropping the dagger on the floor . if he does not , there are some known bugs with the scene : keening may disappear right after you complete the quest , making it unavailable to the player . there is a rare bug where after completing the quest and arniel disappears , none of the quest reward items are left behind . ( this could be because the player stood too far away from his experiment . he advises you to step back , but ignore him and stand beside the crystal . this seems to work for some . ) keening may fall through the floor after arniel vanishes . xbox confirmed ps3 confirmed : i stood in right rear corner of room – the dagger was on left side of the bed in the room below . i heard it hit the ground from just in front of the crystal . check these wiki articles on arniel 's endeavor and keening to make sure you did not miss anything .
the person shooting at the riot shield gets the kill from the ricochet , shown here :
according to the situation described in this post and a reply to a similar question to which that user confirmed the same situation , this seems to be a steam bug related to the newest patch of crusader kings ii .
+xp bonuses on improvements give each ship built in that system a starting experience bonus . the icon on one of the top corners ( can not remember which one ) of the ship portrait shows the level of the ships . experience can also be gained in combat , and through random encounters .
there is no way to increase your basic inventory size ( note : mods could change that in the future ) . however , there are two stashes in town : the personal stash and the shared stash . the shared stash is accessible by every character on your account . in the starting town the two stashes are near the top-most exit ; each stash looks like a chest but their appearances are unique . note that you can filter what drops you can actually see in the options screen . are you picking up lots of whites ? my advice there would be not to bother , and to filter them out . difficulty does not affect drop levels .
here 's a site to details just what drops what kind of items : http://forums.wildshadow.com/wiki/realm-mad-god/equipment these are determined by the type of item ( armor , weapon , ability items , ring , etc . ) and the item 's tier ( amongst its own type ) . also remember that all the drops are random . nothing is ever guaranteed to drop and more often than not monsters drop nothing . bigger groups seem to generate more drops tough , so group up ( more on that later ) . for early game , go after the quests you get . those should direct you to little boss monster ( usually surrounded by smaller monsters ) that drop low tier items to get you started . pirate cave is also a great place to get starting gear and it is easy enough to clear on your own . for late game , to get usefull items , you will need to find either lesser gods ( these roam the woods near the middle of the map ) treasue chest bosses ( special locations , higher tier nearer to the middle of the map ) gods of the realm ( volcanic area near the middle ) or dungeons , doors to which some of the above drop . problem with all of these ( in increasing degree towards the bottom of the list ) is that they are all quite deadly and you will have a hard time dealing with them on your own , even at level 20 . the solution is to not go at it alone . look the minimap in the upper right corner . zoom it all the way out with your mouse wheel and find a big bunch of other players . click one of them and choose " teleport " . more often than not you will be teleported smack in the middle of a fight . the closer to the center of the map the group is , the more likely there will be tough mosters of some sort around for you and your newfound friends to kill . and do not worry too much about getting your loot stolen . the better gear gets dropped in a differently coloured , " soulbound " loot sacks that only you can see and open . however , they only drop if you did enough damage to the monster in question .
i have been slowly working my way through inferno , and i think i have come up with a respectable build . i am focusing on a hybrid dodge/life regen build . skills primary : fists of thunder with lightning flash - the dodge is subject to diminishing returns , but it is still an extra ~8% while i am attacking . that is not bad at all . secondary : lashing tail kick with hand of ytar - this is mostly to keep sweeping wind from falling off . it also helps attract attention from enemies standing in damage spots . skill 1 : serenity with instant karma - mostly my panic button . but with instant karma , when i am in the middle of a giant group , this helps thin the crowd . skill 2 : dashing strike with blinding speed - this helps get me out of damage spots , and gives me a dodge boost while i am at it . skill 3 : sweeping wind with cyclone - nothing like a group of guys trying to beat on you , and dying in the process . at max stacks , it provides a very respectable 45% aoe , with a chance to spawn tornados that do 20% . that is nothing to laugh at . skill 4 : mantra of evasion with hard target - my armor is not very high , so the 20% boost is very helpful . when i get my armor high enough , i will be switching the rune to backlash , for the aoe fire damage . passive 1 : one with everything - pretty self explanatory . focus on a single resistance . passive 2 : seize the initiative - adds dexterity to armor . monks are all about the dexterity . with this single passive , dexterity provides dodge , damage , and armor . passive 3 : the guardian 's path - adds 15% dodge with dual-wielding . since this is a dodge build , this is pure gold . equipment modifiers required , in order of importance : life on hit is the saving grace of this build . it is what keeps you going in the middle of a giant group . if both weapons have 400+ , then fists or daggers will give you over 1000 life per second just for beating on something . slightly less for slower weaponry . enough life on hit means you can basically ignore anything a boss throws at you ( as long is it does not kill you in one hit ) , as the life regeneration will just heal you back to where you were before he even attacked . life regeneration is the secondary concern . life on hit heals burst damage . life regeneration heals damage areas , keeps you up while you run over them to get to ( or away from ) something . also , it is easy enough to replace the mantra of healing entirely with all of two or three pieces of equipment , allowing you to focus on dodging . a single resistance ; it does not matter which one . if you find a piece of equipment that has your chosen resistance and resist all , that is gravy . you can get 90+ resist from one piece of equipment . this will mitigate damage to a very large degree , which is absolutely required for inferno , even for dodging . you are going to get hit . make it hurt as little as possible . dexterity is your all-around do everything stat . more is better , as always . do not skimp on the above for this , though . you will do more damage , yes , but you will also have more trouble surviving the pain being thrown your way . vitality is the last required modifier . this one is last because you do not need a whole lot ; enough to survive the biggest hits , but anything that does not one-shot you will die . this is why i currently have a grand total of 14,000 life . nice to have , but not essential : attack speed is a no-brainer . faster attacks mean more hits , which means more life . the damage boost is a side bonus . strength adds to armor , which is always good . do not look for it , though , as that is all the bonus it give you . intelligence will boost your resistances , and that is never a bad thing . your chosen resistance is better , though , as it takes 10 intelligence to match a single point of resistance . higher critical chance synergizes very well with sweeping wind . if you can get this without sacrificing any required stats , get it . it will crank your dps into overdrive . higher critical damage is just a damage boost . melee/ranged damage reduction is gravy on top of your armor and resistances . i have not tested whether this gets dumped on top of existing armor or not , leading into a straight damage reduction , but like i said earlier , less damage taken is a good thing . control effect reduction will unfreeze and un-jail you that much faster . freeze is the critical one . not being able to attack means you can not bring your life on hit to bear . this is not optimal . not required : thorns are not really needed . yeah , you will damage those that hit you , but between sweeping wind and your third hit , you will already be doing much more to those in front of you . other resistances are entirely useless . they will provide no benefit whatsoever , unless it goes higher than your chosen . in which case , why are you diluting your equipment choices to that extent ? you might as well focus exclusively on resist all , then . playstyle first up , this build will not let you stand there and take arcane sentries and desecrators without moving . i do not think there is any build that will let you do that . so , get used to moving . not to kite , but to pull away from damage spots , arcane sentries , that sort of thing . move is your watchword . moving is life . you can stand and take it from enemies that have reflect damage , fast , vampiric , anything that does not drop a damage spot . even molten is fine , as long as they do not move . just remember , they explode when you kill them . dashing strike dashes you to the other side of the enemy that you are on . it can also dash you out of a tight spot . use this to avoid boss attacks . butcher winds up his big swing ? dash behind him , and keep going . this takes split-second timing , however , as i have found some enemies will wind up , and if you dash before they begin the attack animation , they will turn to hit you . you may have better luck dashing away from your enemies . the dodge bonus from the rune only functions when you hit something . it will not work just dashing from one point to another . also keep in mind that damage spots tend to interrupt the dash , so do not take it as a get out of jail free card . when fighting bosses , champions , anything with over 100,000 health , turn on sweeping wind . you will regain your spirit , and be doing extra damage . if you need to run away , use lashing tail kick on an enemy to keep it from falling off . do not worry about your life dropping ; it is going to happen . it is when you are standing in a plague patch , or other damage area that you need to worry . remember our watchword ? move . why are you trying to imitate a barbarian ? monks are about speed , grace , and balance . flow around the battlefield . let them come to you , away from their arcane sentries and plague patches . a live monk is a happy monk . anything that can not kill you in one hit will die . you will not be able to stand there and take it from arcane or plague champion groups , but normal monsters provide no difficulty . you are going to die from time to time . it happens . do not get frustrated . learn from it , and experiment . vortex sucks you onto an arcane sentry ? hopefully serenity is available . if not , take your lumps and try again . last tip : have fun . if you are not enjoying having to run around to avoid arcane sentries or desecration patches , this build is not for you .
each item simply produces whatever the developers decided that it should . the type of material is based on the difficulty in which you would most likely find the item . in regards to the items mentioned that produce materials for a seemingly higher difficulty , this is because those items would typically be found in nightmare , even though they are below level 30 .
yes . the plan is expended once it is " taught " , but then you can make as many as you can afford .
what you are looking for is a furnace/smelter , which is typically in the shape of a very large , cone-shaped oven . not all forges have a smelter , but whiterun has one . a list of all smelters can be found on this site
as far as i understand it , the only thing that matters for enchanting is the level of creature or human you soul trap . so it does not matter if you use a human soul or a creature soul . however , nearly all soul gems only trap creature souls : only black soul gems will trap human souls . and black soul gems are pretty rare . black soul gems ( including the black star ) work on humans of any level , including common npcs like bandits . so if you are looking to expand your soul trapping opportunities , having nelacar repair it is prudent . however , siding with nelacar will prevent aranea from ever becoming a follower , which might not be what you want . while it is stated to only hold black souls ( humanoids ) it can actually hold all types of souls , making it a straight up upgrade , as long as you are willing to go that way in the quest line . in terms of a quest to collect all the daedric artifacts , i am not aware of any in game . however , if you are an achievement collector , all three platforms have : oblivion walker collect 15 daedric artifacts but both versions of the azura 's star count for it , so choose whatever you want . and as an aside , there is an oghma infinium quest , just not in the same style as oblivion : the reward for the quest discerning the transmundane is the oghma infinium , one of the 15 daedric artifacts .

please note that this answer is impossible to nail down , and with new champions being added at a rate of 1 every 2 weeks , on top of the meta shifting ever so slightly every few months , it is impossible to put together a comprehensive all-encompassing list . factors like region ( eu vs . na ) , elo brackets , 5 man team compositions , fotm picks , and personal bias all have a distinct effect on these picks . i realize this question is old , but i feel compelled to expand upon some points here . note that these points are strongly tied in with the north american metagame , which revolves highly around 5v5 teamfights and lane pushing . the euro servers have a slightly different mentality to them , and thus these may not apply there . high mobility being able to get to and from fights , as well as escape when low / from ganks is important . characters with built in escapes like shaco , kassadin and ahri are all examples of high mobility champions . the inability to gank these characters early-mid to mid game as well as the inability to finish them off in a teamfight without solid cc gives them a distinct presence advantage . lane presence this is fairly broad , but characters that change how you lane can be strong options for bans at times . ults with long range like nocturne , pantheon , twisted fate , ziggs , or pure global ults like gangplank , soraka and karthus all drastically affect how aggressive you can be in lane once those champions hit 6 . this can be especially devastating for a bottom lane who is generally reliant on a strong cs . initiators characters that are designed to force teamfights can often turn tides of the game by controlling when and where fights happen . rammus , galio , maokai , morgana , amumu are all examples of strong initators ( though not necessarily all ban-worthy for various reasons ) . these champs tend to be fairly durable as well , to survive the initial punishment they receive for forcing a fight . this does not necessarily have to be the case though . sona , for example , is incredibly frail but can do an amazing job of initiating with a well placed ult . strong snowball champs snowball champs refer to the ability to jump farther ahead than everyone else in terms of damage/ability once they get even a little bit in front of the competition . characters with scaling and spammable abilities , true damage , sustainability and steroids will often fall into this category . ad carries tend to fall in here , some more than others . you will also see chain-casters ( ryze , cassiopeia , karthus , vlad ) and bruisers with natural damage boosts ( irelia , lee sin ) in this category .
the wood needed in the hearthfire dlc is distinct from the wood you can obtain from any chopping block . you are looking for sawn logs . these can be purchased from several log merchants in the game : aeri - anga 's mill in the pale bolund - the wood mill in falkreath gilfre - mixwater mill in eastmarch grosta - heartwood mill in the rift hert - half-moon mill in falkreath hod - wood mill in riverwood kharag gro-shurkul - solitude sawmill in haafingar thonnir - wood mill in morthal some of these merchants will also allow you to chop lumber from free if you complete enough radiant quests to raise their disposition . note that if you saw your own logs , the merchant must be nearby for you to actually receive the lumber .
you cannot sell them , they are a gift from rockstar for being involved with the rockstar social club . if you are filling up your garage with them , just take them out and drive them into the ocean , blow them up , or simply leave them on the street . if your garage is full , when you enter with another vehicle , it should prompt you for which vehicle you want to replace .
i did some sleuthing on the steam market , and based on the listings , there is consistently about a 10% chance to get an uncommon item , and a 5% chance to get a rare item ( 85% for common items ) . there is no 100% hard data on the actual odds , but i would say the market 's the closest we can get . note that you can obtain uncommon/rare backgrounds and emoticons from non-foil badge crafts . foil badges actually have nothing to do with the items you will get - it is treated the exact same as any other badge craft .
it buffs the goatmen around the drum making them stronger and bigger . also slower as well .
i do not think there is a way to do exactly what you describe . if i am wrong , i would love to know about it ! the second best thing i can find is to set a waypoint to follow a unit in your main attack group . to do this , select your production buildings , find a unit that is not likely to die anytime soon , and right click that unit . new units being produced will follow your main group , and will attack nearby enemies and such . however , they still will not be in the actual control group , so you can not easily use their spells and whatnot . in order to set that up , the easiest way i have found is to select the units as they are walking toward your group ( it is good to listen for " construction finished " sound bites and hit space ) and then press shift + 3 to include them in the original group . two things to watch out for : units heading toward waypoints are using the " move " command and will not attack stuff en route . if the unit you are following is destroyed , the waypoint will end up wherever it was when it was destroyed . if this is right at the front of the enemy base , that is bad .
there are two turtleshells in that level , a green and a red one . use the turtleshells to swim towards him , and once you are within strinking distance , do a ' spin ' attack so that you throw the turtleshell . it takes 5 hits to defeat him . after the first hit , he releases homing piranhas that come after you . dodge these by making quick turns . there is also a power mushroom that gives you 6 health .
i think the best solution in the early game is to explore your starting biome and search for shallow caves that contain treasure . you will likely find a boomerang early , which can be useful as a ranged and indirect fire weapon early in the game . once you have come across a few chests and have a bit of gear/weapons , start digging a shaft . explore caves and fight enemies , which will probably yield some amount of cash plus opportunities to mine ores you can use to forge better equipment . better equipment will allow you to dig deeper and/or explore some of the neighboring biomes , which will yield opportunities for even better gear . money 's not super important as most of the gear in the game can be crafted or found as treasure . you will need to purchase items from time to time , so make sure that you occasionally make time to satisfy the conditions for npcs to arrive . lather , rinse , and repeat until you are epic and difficult to kill , and then you can tackle some of the more exciting boss fights and deepest regions of the world . if you are at a loss as to what to do next , or how to craft some of the higher level gear , go dig around a bit at one of the terraria wiki sites , which contain info about all sorts of interesting artifacts . death is relatively cheap , as long as you leave as much of your money as possible at home . do not be afraid to go and explore something new , you might luck out and find a valuable artifact . the worst case scenario is that you end up a tasty snack for something big and nasty , and maybe lose a few coins . the goal of this game varies depending on what your goal is , so do not be afraid to do something risky or try something new if you are having fun ! if the game is getting frustrating , try exploring more closer to the surface , or looking up a strategy for dealing with the particular situation you are stuck on .
there is no option to change the difficulty later in the game but you can use mods for that like : http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/difficulty_settings_mod
as far as i know it is impossible without using a mod , but maybe in some future release . . . i hope so .

i answered a similar question to this : how do i get more guns ? . noticed that your question was posted a few hours before that though . this is the new " arms deal " update which went live on 14/08/2013 . valve released a really good faq on it , which can be found here . the bits of interest for your particular question , " how do i get item drops ? ": timed weapon drops , just by playing on official and community servers ( vac enabled ) in any game mode . opening dropped weapon cases with a weapon case key . trade weapons with other players through steam 's trading interface . purchase them from other players through the steam marketplace . regarding the first point , these are obtained for play time over the course of a week . as your play time increases , the drop rate will slow down . this is reset when the week rolls over . not sure the start day or time of a week though . i am not 100% sure where you will get the weapon case keys . the below quote suggests that you buy these : this update will also actively support the cs:go competitive community with the introduction of the esports weapon case . a portion of the proceeds from sales of esports case keys will go towards prize purses at competitive events . hope that helps .
creature speed is not modified by hero stats . . . with one exception . if you have the armageddon 's blade expansion , you can hire sir mullich , a castle hero , who gives +2 to all creatures under his command . see here : armageddon 's blade features creature speed is modified by the terrain type where the battle takes place . creatures get a +1 bonus to speed if they are on native terrain . if i remember rightly , for the fortress creatures , that is swamp ; for the tower , that is snow ; and so forth . creature speed can also be modified by spells such as haste and slow , of course .
i know some people have answered this but i thought i could add a little data . for gas , full saturation is 3 , however the third is not worth as much as the first two . as a result its worth getting a second geyser before putting a third worker on the first . this is also true for minerals as shown by this graph : as you can see after your first 16 workers the gain per worker starts to decrease dramatically . as a result when you start an expansion you should shift any excess workers ( over 16 ) to the new expansion . the original research can be found in this paper : worker income efficiency in starcraft ii by chet ' cheticus ' v . the paper reports original data collection and methods , as well as the formula 's uses for the ' least squares regression . '
advantages : you get access to that resource if you have the right tech ( so it can be a good idea to build a city on strategically important resources like iron , oil , etc . - they will be better protected from spies and enemy units ) . you do not need to wait several turns until the worker builds the improvement . in fact resources do give some kind of tile bonus if you build a city on them . this means +1 commerce for commerce resources ( dye , gold , etc . ) , +1 food for food resources ( pig , wheat , etc . , but only on plain terrain , not hills ) , +1 hammer for production resources ( iron , ivory , etc . but +2 on hills ) . even though these numbers seem to be small , in the beginning it can still be a big boost to a new city . disadvantages : you cannot build improvements on the resource , so in the long run you lose the huge hammer/commerce/food bonuses that would result from the improvement .
from the faq : can i upgrade my game badge ? if you gather another complete set of trading cards you can upgrade that game badge . you can craft a set for a game at most five times . each time you upgrade the game badge you will get an extra 100xp , as well as upgrading the image and title of the badge .
yes , they will move in . the only wall requirement is that it is solid . as with spikes , npcs do not take damage from contact with the hellstone . although hellstone emits light , it does not count as a room 's light source ; hence the torch .
i am afraid it is just a bug : statistics and achievements sometimes reset for no reason at all . achievements also reset when you update the game , install mods , uninstall mods , etc .
open your friends list and change your status to offline , and that should be what you need . you can not do it for specific friends , but if you are just trying to play solo that will do the trick .
me soloing bronze as a human infiltrator , all my points in everything but cryo blast , using black widow and m-3 predator . i used no equipment but had to use medi-gels and rockets becuase lucky me had 3 hacking missions on my solo . . sigh there are many factors that would come into play that will assist you in completeing a bronze mission solo : being level ~20 is going to be almost necessary as you are gonna need every available power upgraded as much as possible to give you the advantages you will need . the right weapons per your class that you use and the know how when it comes to using your powers . playing a map you are definately familiar with , making sure you know all the ammo locations and every important choke point on the map so you can grab ammo without delay as you move to the next choking point to funnel the enemies through . not being afraid to use your rockets and medi-gels as well as making sure you dont waste them unecessarily , saving your rockets for the 10th and 11th waves where you will find yourself overwhelmed by heavy units and really no way to retreat . plan ahead , dont run around finding a good spot to setup shop . have a plan , when you feel like you are being make sure you know where you are going next and what path to take to avoid enemies . never be without ammo , having to rely on powers works for a lot of classes but have no ammo can be deadly . know the class you are playing , there is nothing more deadly then playing a character you only have the basic grasp of . fight against the enemy your class has advantages against , i.e. dont bring sabotage to a reaper fight . adept : crowd control from stasis ( make sure you get rank 6:bubble ) or singularity and a little bit of combination from warp you will have a serious advantage over a multitude of solders . using warp and throw in combination on units such as ravagers , brutes , banshees , atlas ' , and geth primes to create a biotic explosion and you will tear through their armored health . if you use the weapons m-12 locust with the mod smg ultralight material and the m-3 predator the weight of the weapons will not affect your power recharge percentage allowing you the ability to lay down some fire on the little guys . infiltrator : having a semi-automatic sniper rifle is desirable in this case , allowing you to headshot multiple enemies and thinning the crowds . make sure that your tactical cloak is specced rank 4 damage increase damage bonus by 30% , rank 5 recharge speed increase recharge speed by 30% , rank 6 sniper damage increase sniper rifle damage by 40% while cloaked . as well as speccing into sheilds and health bonuses . bringing along a light pistol will come in handy for close quarters as you race to each position , putting distance between your enemies . vanguard : vanguards obviously rely completely on their powers to inflict massive damage to their enemies . ultimately this character is incredible powerful but extremely risky when you are alone and dont have allies to lay down covering fire . i would suggest constantly having caution and never stay out of cover for more then a couple hits before rushing to safety . dont be afraid to fire a couple quick headshots to remove a couple of the stray buggers that get back up after your wave of destruction . engineer : another power class that only excels with constant casting of powers . stay behind cover while always having your drone/turret/decoy up to distract them from firing upon you as you launch power after power into the crowds . make sure you have a high power recharge and only carry light weapons as you will not be needing them extensively . keeping in mind all the strategy tips i mentioned before you shall survive . sentinal : these guys are great at surviving and have an amazing panic button when you get surrounded . have your tech armor upgraded to increase damage reduction so you can continuously lay down heavy fire on your enemies so they dont get the upper hand on you . these guys you dont have to worry so much about power recharge so you get to pick any number of weapon combinations to keep up the heavy damage . soldier : an incredibly versatile character with a decent survivability . the races for soldiers are incredibly different from eachother and obviously have their advantages . krogans have increased defensive capabilites and turians have increased fire rate . use whatever weapons you are comfortable with and you will be fine . little update for you , i found a couple videos for you they completed bronze solo . sentinals , vanguards , engineers and infiltrator
i am . . . not quite sure how to answer your question . there are 4 different endings in the game , each with its own button . press the button and you get the ending you choose . eliza tells you the ramifications of each ending .
up until now there is no option to merge portals . i like reporting inaccurate/incorrect things . being a perfectionist makes me feel obliged to do so , and i agree with what you say with regards to the edits/reports being rejected , etc . the thing is , the edits/reports sent through is reviewed by actual people on the other side , which makes this a timely process . secondly , they try to review these things as best they can , the accuracy of which is dependent on the person/people reviewing the edit/report , as well as the information and knowledge available to them . my thinking is that if multiple agents report the same error , it will take .
water turrets is the only defense that will consume water each night . it only does so if you have voted to upgrade it at least once , and if you do not have enough water in the well during the attack , you will not get the benefit of any of the upgrades ( it still provides the base defense ) . the amount of water is equal to the amount it consumes , which goes 2-4-6-9-12 based on how many times you have upgraded the turrets . towns may upgrade the water turrets but intentionally take all the water out of the well and store it in the bank unless they need the upgraded defense that day . none of the other water defenses require water from the well , and they will all work regardless of the amount of water in the well . contrary to what the wiki implies , building plumbing has no effect on the cost to build water-based defenses , nor on the nightly upkeep of water turrets .
you get a debuff at every fight . if i recall correctly : minor health drain at every turn .
it is in ~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/UserSettings.ini i had to run find to locate it .
generation v removed contests , and therefore provides no methods to raise or check any of contest stats of a pokémon , excluding the feebas evolution for checking beauty . there are a few approaches involving third-party tools to viewing the stats of your pokémon in detail ( such as dumping the save , or tricking the game to use an incorrect gts server ) , and since the old contest stats are still present on a pokémon ( which is why the classic feebas evolution still works ) , you can use one of those to view these stats . however , they have no effect at all in generation v ( again , excluding feebas evolution ) , so there is not much point in doing so .
if you played the original fourteen , you already have an account , and all you need to play ( even with your old character , if you like ) is go to account management and subscribe . having legacy status ( obtained by being subscribed to the original fourteen for three months ) gives you a permanent discount on arr subscription . in either case , if you already had an account at arr 's release , you should have gotten two weeks of subscription for free . as of this writing , you should still have a week left : try logging into the game .
since this is a text game , you can simply use your browser’s find function . there are in fact four more asterisks , but they are just part of the castle towers and not special :
yes , all models of the ps3 are backwards compatible with the ps1 . only some models are backwards compatible with the ps2 . you can save your games to the ps3 hdd , or ( if you need to import old saved games ) you can buy an adapter . the adapter costs about $30 and is available on amazon : http://www.amazon.com/playstation-3-memory-card-adaptor/dp/b000k1gziu
this is impossible . for a start , to win the lottery side-quest you have to go back in time at least once to know what the numbers are going to be/were . to get the lover 's mask side-quest completed you need to return to the first day and show the lover 's mask to the major to get a heart piece .
this is a major bug , most players have encountered it , and sadly there is no known workaround that lets you buy this house or start the mission that grants you the option to buy it from he steward .
holy bolt ( paladin ) and enchant ( sorceress ) are the only spells that can be directly cast on allies and allied minions ( i.e. . actually targeting the ally with the spell ) . three barbarian warcries can be used which affect all allies who are present when the skill is cast : shout , battle orders , and battle command . i think those are the only which actually qualify as being " cast on friendly players " , although there are other skills which act as buffs you can give to friendly players as long as they are close to you ( passive auras , although in some cases the aura needs to be kept on an active skill slot ) . they lose the buffs as they go out of range , and automatically regain the buff when they are in range again . there are quite a few aura skills for the paladin which , when active , affect all nearby allies : resist fire , resist cold , resist lightning , cleansing , vigor , meditation , and salvation all of the defensive auras tree , as well as might , thorns , blessed aim , concentration , and fanaticism from the offensive auras tree . the druid has a couple spells which summon creatures which radiate auras : oak sage , heart of wolverine , and spirit of barbs some of these can also be granted by items or act 2 mercs .
the deckers you get during the game , whether they are hired or story-given , always come with their own programs and , nine times out of ten , their entire deck is already filled with the programs they can and will use . same goes for esps . the programs and esps that you buy as a character can only be used by you . so , if you are not a decker , i would not worry too much about the decking vendor . you are hiring another guy to do the job . he is got his own tools and knows he can get it done . that is usually the end of it there . i do not know about shamans and summoning fetishes , though . i have always hired my shamans with them having at least two summoning fetishes , so i have not needed to buy more . what i have been finding is that the only items you can ' share ' with your runners are consumable items .
to break one , use a pickaxe , preferably iron level or higher . note , once you destroy one , it will not drop as a block , so break these only if you had like to get rid of them permanently . while your opinion may differ , i find spawners to be excellent exp farms , and you can turn yours into a mob farm . if you had rather save your mob spawner , you need to block it off with light , similar to placing torches in a cave to ward off mob spawns . to de-activate a mob spawner , place torches around the spawner ( at least an 8 block radius ) to prevent mobs from spawning . put them adjacent to the block itself .
items will disappear if they are on the ground for 5 minutes after you die . this timer starts ticking as soon as you die ; even on the death screen that timer is going to keep counting , so if you go take a break to grab some food and come back to find out your character 's been lying around dead for 10 minutes , your items are gone . also , dying in lava or fire will make you lose any items that fall into the flames . items that fall onto cactus are also destroyed . caveat : if you spawn far enough away from where you died and the chunk becomes unloaded , the item timers will freeze until the chunk is loaded again .
duping works just like it did on borderlands 1 , you simply have a friend make a multiplayer game , join as a guest , drop the item ( s ) you want , then force quit the game ( alt f4 , do not use the menu ) . if all works as planned , the host will still have those items , and since your game did not save the state of you not having the item , your character has it too . the character duping weapons should join as a guest so this goes smoothly . i am not aware of any way to do this single player on pc or console ( though single players on pc can simply use the gibbed save editor to do basically the same thing ) . do not do this with random matchmaking players , do it with friends for obvious reliability reasons . since there is no particularly simple way to prevent this , duping has never been ( effectively ) patched out of the game . note if you do this , steam may complain about cloud saves not matching local saves . always continue on local saves when doing this , as your cloud save is probably out of date due to the force quit .
the problem is that either the server cannot connect to minecraft .netor that the person getting that error does not have a legitimate minecraft account and so the server is refusing access . the way to solve this is either to get all players a premium minecraft account , or to change online-mode to false to stop it from checking the validity of the other account .
the minecraft wiki shows that there are many variables that affect animal spawnings as of version 1.3.2 . one in ten newly generated chunks will contain mobs ( includes any animal , monster , or utility ) . they can show up in as many as four ' packs ' of the same mob . they will always spawn on the highest point ( the blocks that you see if you were flying ) . therefore , if the world generator had to choose between spawning an animal on a ledge or inside a cave , it would choose the ledge . the block that the animal spawns on must be opaque ( not glass , water , lava , etc ) . pigs spawn in groups of either three or four . sheep spawn in groups of two to eight . cows spawn in groups of four , and can spawn up to twelve . chickens spawn in groups of as much as three . when chicken eggs are thrown , there is a 1/8 chance of a baby chicken spawning . there is also a 1/32 chance of four spawning instead of one . before version 1.6 , they only spawned when the light level was over nine , now they spawn regardless of whatever light level . the block two blocks above the opaque block must be non-opaque ( tree leaf , water , lava , glass ) . animals ( excluding squid ) do not spawn in ocean biomes . no animals normally spawn in desert biomes . the spawning of animals is dependent on the world seed . this means that if i make a world with default settings and the seed ' minecraft ' and you do that same , the cows and pigs will spawn in the exact same places . very rarely , new animals can spawn in already generated chunks , like monsters . when this happens , as well as when mobs spawn from a mob spawner , the following rules apply : the light level must be nine or more . the opaque must be a grass block ( not a dirt block ) . unlike monsters , animals do not spontaneously despawn , except for wild ocelots and wolves ( which can despawn only when they are hostile ) . they do not despawn even if the player is far from them . note that squids have different spawning criteria then other mobs . they can spawn at any light level underwater . they will also spawn in player made pools and sometimes they will spawn in underground water deposits . it is technically possible for them to spawn in one block of water , but that is not very likely .
no , you cannot #name items except those in your inventory . when you use the command #name , it only takes an inventory letter as an argument . a good strategy is to simply never pick up a gray stone unless you are sure it is not a loadstone or to pick it up , uncurse it somehow , #name it , and drop it again . you can always test whether any individual gray stone is a loadstone by kicking it without wearing boots of kicking . if it moves , it is not a loadstone . then if you do pick it up , you can #name it " not loadstone " or something more specific if you can figure it out . then if you ever have three different names for different gray stones , any unnamed gray stone is a loadstone . you can check what items you have names for with \ . there is more information about loadstones and #name on the wiki .
they are usually called " endless survival games " and are in the same vein as canabalt or robot unicorn attack .
ok , i found a way that is at least , not as painful , though it is still not super fast . the scholar type crafting professions ( sage , artificing , and alchemy ) can create skill learning items for various classes . skill items of at least expert level can be transmuted like treasured or mastercrafted items . unlike mastercrafted items , these items can have levels other than x1 and x2 . this seems to be the only way to craft transmutable items high enough level to give a decent chance at skillups . there is also a mount you can get from a crafting quest chain in butcherblock mountains that increases your transmutation skill by 9 .
there are several problems with hell and several ways to overcome them . hellstone wearing an obsidian skull will stop you being bunt from standing on it . putting sand on top of the block before mining will remove the lava that is created . the buildings in hell give an excellent vantage point for mining the hellstone through the wall . lava rocket boots allow you to cross large lava lakes easily , they are sold by the npc goblin tinkerer . grappling hooks or ivy whips work in similar ways . placing sand above the lava will remove it when the sand falls into it , but you have to build up from the bottom . water walking potions also allow you to walk on lava without being hurt . there is a trick with flippers that allow you to swim above the lava .
most stats of event pokemon are pre-determined , set by the event itself . so , all event torchics are indeed male . depending on the event , nature can be preset although it was not the case with the torchic event . as for other pokemon , we cannot know for sure as no event pokemon have been released . as for wild pokemon , of the new ones released in x/y , only the flabebe line has a mono-gender distribution , being 100% female .
there are only a few single-player missions that effect the in-game stock market , and they are mostly concentrated around the lester assassination missions . the companies involved in the heists , including vangelico , do not appear to have any useful/exploitable effect on the market . the advice i followed to track the events that effect the market in single player is on this page . lester does a pretty good job of informing you how to invest during these missions , though . if you wait until after the final heist to do as many of these missions as you can , you stand to make a pretty good profit .
towards the beginning of act iii , you will find fallen and some equivalent mages who can generate more fallen . if you avoid killing the mages , you can have fights that go on endlessly . it took me five minutes to fight my way down some stairs once because the fallen would never , ever stop coming .

edit well since people are actually reading this , there is a little bit more information on each point . the answers in order : yes - all quests reset - the game begins just as though you had started at lvl 1 ( minus the character selection , so you will have to do everything over again ( including the tutorial ! ) no - you keep everything - this is pretty straightforward , what you have on you at the end of playthrough 1 stays with you . however , items in playthrough 2 are scaled ( see below on scaling ) . so you will find the same named weapons but they will have better stats , so do not just ignore them . yes - mobs scale to your level -it is expected that after completing your first playthrough you will be around lvl 35 ( give or take ) . therefore when you start a new game , the mobs will have 35 added to their level ( again give or take a level ) . which is why specific enemies ( like crawmerax for example ) have a set level . if you are looking to do the secret armory of general knoxx , you should be lvl 50ish ( about 2.5 playthroughs ) . no - you can go find it in playthrough 2 , or you can access playthrough one with your current character ( so if you have gained a level in playthrough 2 , that level sticks when going back to playthrough 1 ) . this includes any subsequent playthroughs . hope that helps !
it is the most important to max out the fatal bonds . this spell is very important since it will deal damage to the hero even if he is not in range . you should not forget about the other damaging spells and you very powerful ultimate . to babysit properly you should sit in front of the battling creeps so that your carry can farm with no worries and you harass the enemy hero . take note that when you attack the enemy hero , you get aggro from his creeps . you can lose quickly aggro by attacking your own creeps using Ctrl + A + click on friendly creep . this will make you lose aggro ( even from enemy towers ! ) . this way you harass the enemy and make the enemy creeps lose momentum by switching targets very often . your carry ( supposing you babysit a carry , , otherwise it is pretty pointless ) should only last hit the enemy creeps because you do not want to push the lane too much so that you stay in the safe area . regarding items , you should put observer wards the near forest ( if radiant bottom or if dire top ) you should go for Arcane Boots and Mekansm or Pipe of insight . these are items that are quite cheap and they are of course sometimes situational , but usually they come in handy when playing a true support . a very important item for the warlock though is the Refresher Orb since it doubles your ultimate and Aghanim's Scepter that makes your ultimate spawn 2 infernal golems . you could also use Rod of Atos a very powerful item that is underused . it cripples the enemy hero slowing him a lot and it has a pretty huge range .
check out the " testing hidden power " section from bulbapedia : players are able to test what the type of their hidden power is most often by utilizing a kecleon . it does not have to be their own , though this makes it more convenient . entering any double battle with the pokémon with hidden power and kecleon at the front of the list , then using hidden power on the kecleon will cause it to change types to the type that hidden power is , or , if the hidden power is a ghost-type move , cause nothing to happen due to kecleon 's immunity . however , in platinum , there is a man in the veilstone game corner prize exchange house that will tell the player the type of their pokémon 's hidden power , and , even if the pokémon does not know hidden power , the type that it would have . in heartgold and soulsilver , he is present in the celadon game corner prize exchange house . in black and white , he is present in the pokémon center in mistralton city . in black 2 and white 2 , he is been relocated to the pokémon world tournament . so in platinum and later gen 4/5 games you could easily check the move , but in diamond/pearl your best bet is to make use of a kecleon . it is still fairly time consuming to set this up , all for what is almost always a weak to middling power move . note that hidden power 's max power is 70 ( min 30 ) , and you can not control what power your pokemon will have , save for breeding/catching a new one with specific ( painfully specific ) ivs . it is extremely rare that hidden power is particularly useful except as a mid-level damage dealing move when your pokemon has not naturally learned enough mediocre moves to fill out their skill set . i would recommend just not using it at all if you do not have some devious strategy in mind like teaching a water hidden power to a fire pokemon or something . for competitive purposes it is a great way to teach a special attacker a move type they would not otherwise get , but for the other 99% of us it is yet another mediocre skill .
judging from your question you want sc2 over lan without connecting via the internet . there is no easy way to do this . as mckay points out , as long as all computers are connected to the internet you can use computers which happen to be connected to the same lan , but make no mistake you will not be leveraging the advantage of said lan . now i said " easy way , " because there is a " hard way . " blizzard does have a lan client of starcraft ii which is provides for reputable tournaments . gaining access to this requires setting yourself up as a business organization and paying a licensing fee . for more information you are going to have to contact blizzard directly . that said , for a couple of friends , there is no legal way to leverage your lan for sc2 games without going through blizzard .
the information you are looking for is currently at this location . i do believe it safe to call this thread the origin of all this madness as its now on its 7th incarnation and they are still working on the math of it all . however , to sum it up : the max cap gear is pretty much based on maxing out those skills to 100 as well . the reason this is done is because it saves you perk points . wasting perks when they could be put into other areas other than making your gear work better is pretty much the point of that thread . . . how few perks can you use so you can be whatever character you want to be and still have very effective gear . its honestly not that hard to do in the long run and will always net you a surplus in cash when leveling them up . now , that being said . there is the restoration loop that , if done enough in a row can likely get you what you want . . . though i honestly think it easier to get those skills to 100 rather then try to meet the timings of the restoration loop . ( i do not even consider trying to do that loop until my skills are at 100 each ) . my usual caution with the restoration loop , it is possible to make game breaking items by utilizing it , even though it is 100% through in-game mechanics . . just take care not to ruin the game for yourself and use it where appropriate . for instance , i have a character who will only ever wear fur armor ( i collect ever piece of it i can so i can improve my enchantments on it and so forth ) . i will eventually use the restoration loop to make a very nice set of armor for the character . . which is a mage . . . and let me tell you , not using those -cost +regen robes realllly makes for an interesting time : )
they are entirely different . shadow warrior will give you a second of invisibility after you crouch , to disrupt remote enemies ' lock on you . it cannot be used for getting around unnoticed , only escapes . nocturnal 's agent of stealth is pretty weak as greater powers go , unless you are sworn not to use illusion magic . personally , i do not feel either ability is worth the investment . illusion magic is incredibly versatile , and you will probably want to max it anyway on your quest to level 81 . my favorite nocturnal ability is the agent of subterfuge , a high-level area frenzy spell .

resorath and the wiki are correct ; dark templar indeed are cloaked while warping in . in this screenshot , the two sentries ignore the dark templar during it is warp in : but once we add a raven to the mix , the sentries switch their focus to the templar soon after the warp in initiates :
blue 's health was sort of recently increased with a patch ; i suppose it is possible that introduced a glitch where he can have more health than destroying his crystals will reduce . however in addition to his health restoring , the crystals on this legs will also regrow after a minute or two , adding back 30% of his health . presumably waiting for his crystals to grow back will let you kill him . i do believe it is a bug that you saw , he definitely can and is supposed to die when all three legs are " broken " and has died like that for me several times ( there is even a challenge for killing him before his leg crystals respawn ) . but since his legs regrowing restores less than 1/3rd of his health i assume that by destroying them you will eventually whittle him down but i have not personally seen him survive all three legs breaking . like all crystalisks he does not have any weak points but his legs .
yes , you can even abuse it to stack stuff that is normally not stack-able like wands in the crafting screen and then pull the stack out . if you then use the wand and it burns out , it'll look as if the entire stack is burned out , but if you unstack them again inside a crafting screen only the top one will be . i have not had any problems doing this with saving yet , but then i play with permadeath so i rarely save . some might consider this to be an exploit , but since this is a single player game it is up to you to decide if want to use this trick or not .
yes , just copy the world you want to share to minecraft server directory , delete old world named " world " , and rename the directory of your single player world to " world " . you can insert single player world into smp .
you first need to craft a soldering iron and at least one circuit board on a carpenter . the size of the circuit board determines how many tubes can be crafted onto it – one , two , and three respectively . right-clicking with the soldering iron will bring up a custom ( and not very self-explanatory ) crafting screen . first place your desired electron tubes on the left . the text beside each slot will tell you what that type of tube will accomplish , and how many of them can be on a single circuit board . once you have the set of tubes desired , put your target circuit board in the top-right slot – it will move immediately to the bottom-right slot and the tubes will disappear . the tooltip for the crafted circuit board will change to indicate its new effects . note that putting the board in last can be important – if you put it in first , then it will craft as soon as you place the first tube on the left , which might create a board you did not intend if you placed the wrong tube or wanted multiple tubes . you cannot solder additional tubes onto the larger boards afterwards . once you have your soldered board , put it in the engine . to remove it , you need the soldering iron again – drag it over the installed board and click to uninstall it . breaking an engine while it has a circuit board installed will destroy the board .
according to this thread posted by one of the developers on the steam forums , the achievement for sector 3 is broken and will not unlock , along with finale find the developers tough going part 1 tough going part 2 fizzicks edit : the achievements appear to be fixed . the achievement for sector 3 can now be obtained simply by playing through the sector like with all of the other achievements . i tested and every one of the previously broken achievements can now be obtained .
from the in-game manual : the final list , the ' development list ' , will likely feature a number of your most talented youngsters at the club . by placing them on this list , you will effectively be asking your director of football ( or other member of staff responsible for this ) to look to loan them out to suitable clubs to further their development . you can use the staff screen ( in full mode , not classic ) to assign responsibility for youth development to another member of staff ( eg . director of football , assistance manager or youth coach ) . that member of staff will try to find loan opportunities for players that you place on the list .
the big benefit is that instead of weapon fragments , you can capture their weapons intact . early in the game , when resources are scarce , this can give you an advantage - you do not have to spend money on advanced plasma weaponry , you can just steal the alien 's weapons and use them against them . you can also " sell " the spares in certain cases , but only if the council requests them . do note that you will have to research the weapon before you can equip it . having one to research can bypass part of the research requirements , but you will still have to have researched certain prerequisites before you can research plasma weapons . for instance , you can research " plasma rifle " without researching " light plasma rifle " if you have a plasma rifle weapon from a stunned enemy . in either case , you will need to have researched " weapon fragments " though .
posting this question/answer here , since the solution does not appear to exist anywhere else ( outside of my own steam forums post ) : apparently garry 's mod uses internet explorer somehow for its " fastdl " downloading . if internet explorer can not connect to the internet for whatever reason , then garry 's mod will not download anything . in my case , ie was set to offline-mode . setting it to online fixed the issue . other things you can try : make sure Options --&gt; Multiplayer --&gt; Download Custom Content is set to Allow All Custom Files From Server try adding the following lines to the bottom of your garry 's mod config file , located at Steam\steamapps\&lt;username&gt;\garrysmod\garrysmod\cfg\config.cfg: cl_allowdownload 1 cl_downloadfilter all download_debug 0 sv_downloadurl ""  verify the integrity of the game files . within steam : Library --&gt; Garry's Mod --&gt; Right Click --&gt; Properties --&gt; Local Files --&gt; "Verify Integrity of Game Cache" try disabling your firewall/antivirus , or possibly other non-essential programs/services running . try deleting your maps , lua , addons , and cache folders in the garrysmod folder , located at Steam\steamapps\&lt;username&gt;\garrysmod\garrysmod . then verify your cache again . as a last resort , uninstall garry 's mod completely and delete the garrysmod folder ( which you will have to do by hand , because there will be leftover files ) , then reinstall .
no . range mods only affect the melee attacks you use , not thrown projectiles . from the wiki : reach increases the range of a melee weapon 's attacks , except glaive ( prime ) and kestrel throws . reach also increases the range at which sentinels can attack enemies if installed on a sentinel weapon . if you are looking to increase the throwing distance , the only choice is to build glaive prime , which has shown in tests to have a slightly longer range than it is normal counterpart , the glaive , and the kestrel .
i will duplicate some stuff from dalshim , but some of his points are not so important , and some are missing . play on normal stick together it is better to have a non-full team ( i.e. . less than 4 ) than to take bad players into it . three players is ok . if you want to take hornet barrage ( or , even worse , smart bomb ) , better take electric charged armor ( it is very useful , not only against parasites which may ruin your session ) or freeze grenades the more medics the better ( the best loadout for medic would be flamethrower + healgun ) . you should not be a peace medic ; such characters are just too vulnerable ! use jaeger with vindicator to kill the aliens efficiently ! it is a complete disgrace to take flamethrower if you are an officer . tech could take a sentry ( a simple one , not the " sophisticated " but less useful ones ) for the missions where you stay in some place for a long time , and officers can carry incendiary mines which are even better . in my personal opinion , special weapons class is mostly useless . better take one more medic .
the input for this move has to be executed extremely fast . if you messed it up , it is because you were too slow . i am talking consecutive frames fast . the best way to practice this is to crouch and just put in the ab as fast as you can . this way you eliminate any motion on the joystick and learn just how fast the button press has to be . the only way i can perform this move consistently is to place my thumb on one side of the a button , then slide it as fast as i can across the controller , hitting a and b in succession in the process . it is fast , and even that is not reliable . remember that you must release a before hitting b for this to work . if the game registers that b is pressed while a is still held , the input will fail . strategically , unless you plan on going to high-end tournaments , i do not think this should be a move you add to your arsenal . the input timing is just too strict and the move is physically difficult to execute . you are probably better off looking for another quick yoshimitsu move . on the other hand , tournament players consider this one of yoshimitsu 's bread and butter moves , so if you really want to get to the top of your game , prepare to spend quite a while mastering this .
although the links provided in the question answer it fully , just so we have an accurate answer on the site . zilean 's chrono shift ability . caveats being : chrono shift will not activate if the holder is killed by the nexus obelisk . chrono shift will always take precedence over other revival abilities , like guardian angel and rebirth . guardian angel item . caveats being : the passive does not activate when killed by the nexus obelisk . its passive will always activate before rebirth , but after the chrono shift buff if the owner has it . 3a aniva 's rebirth ability . caveats being : if anivia is affected by chrono shift , omen of death and/or guardian angel , chrono shift will activate first , guardian angel second , and rebirth will be third . omen of death will have last priority , granting anivia the potential to survive up to four " deaths " . 3b zac 's cell division passive . each bloblet is 12% of zac 's max health , has 50% of his armor/mr , and take 33% reduced ae damage . based on the bloblet 's life on joining is the amount zac will be at . ( eg . if ones dead , another is at 50% and the other 2 are at 100% , zac will revive at 30% ) . bloblet 's are treated as minions in terms of abilities like consume and smite . 3c aatrox 's blood well passive . the amount of health returned is equal to the amount in the blood well + ( 10.5 + 15.75*lvl ) . affected by passive of spirit visage . yorick 's omen of death ability . caveats being : omen of death has the lowest priority in terms of revival because it does not resurrect the champion , only revives them temporarily . this means that if an ally were to die while under the effects of zilean 's chrono shift or guardian angel as well as omen of death , the champion would be affected by the one that prevents death . in dominion , during the reincarnation of omen of death , yorick or the champion brought back can not capture a point or stabilize a point to stop it from firing at an ally . during the reincarnation of omen of death , you cannot use any summoner spells . other notes : although not considered a revive ability , mordekaiser 's children of the grave ability has lowest priority . in most cases , the debuff is cleared by the original death if the person is revived . when aniva 's ghost is revived by this ability , it may enter the egg state , but this will not affect the actual aniva 's ability cooldown .
just ' use ' it anywhere . the energy dash blueprint you have is a type of tech that gets added to the tech station on-board the ship . once you have unlocked tech , go to the tech station on your ship , select a tech on the left , then click one of the " lock-in " buttons on the right to equip that tech . i do not think it tells you how to use it , but the energy dash is used by double tapping left or right for whichever direction you want to dash in . when using other blueprints , such as furniture or weapons , a little pop-up at the bottom of the screen will say " learned to craft new item " confirming usage . the recipe will then be available for crafting at the crafting station used to make that particular item .
i do not think there is a way to do it in the gui . as you have seen it is possible , but you have to use the console . first , you have to have the console enabled . then just hit ` , or whatever the console is set as and type say &lt;message&gt; .
diamond skin scales exclusively with character level , though as mentioned it absorbs damage after reduction is calculated . the only way to increase its damage absorption directly is to use the rune that doubles its base absorption value .
this one took me a bit of thinking . think hard about why you can not exit the level . there is nothing in the level code that stops you , so it must be coming from somewhere else . slightly further hint : there is also a scripts/ folder in the menu . even further hint : you can edit the black sections of the scripts , same as you can for a level . make sure you ' execute ' while in the script you have edited , not the level code . the script seems to revert if you change files .
you can not install games on external usb drives . games will only run off of the internal hard drive . you can replace the internal hard drive . it will take any standard sata 2.5" ( laptop-sized ) drive . the drive will be reformatted automatically . see how to upgrade your ps3 hard drive . i upgraded to a 1 tb drive . it took maybe ten minutes to do the swap , but a few hours to backup before the swap and a few more to restore . you can back up to a usb hard drive , though it takes forever .
no , its not currently possible to change the ownership of a minecraft xbla save game file , at least using legitimate means . if you put the save game on a usb stick , there are pc applications that can hack the file , but those are officially a violation of the microsoft xbla user-level agreement .
there does not seem to be any official way . then again , modding the game by splaying open and modifying the internals of the . jar file was never really officially supported , either . the new launcher is , ultimately , part of a rather large series of changes to minecraft , including making mods actually something the game supports via the new resource pack stuff , but until that time , modding is a bit more awkward . however , there is still a way to do it . go into the versions folder inside .minecraft , and copy the version you want to mod . rename the copied folder , and both the files inside , to some new name , say " modded 1 . blah " . lastly , open the . json file in a text editor , and change the line that will read something like "id": "1.6.1", so that the id matches the new name . the new launcher should now show a version " modded 1 . blah " in the list , but since that version does not exist on the minecraft servers , it will not get overwritten . splay open and tinker with the . jar file in there the same way you always would with the old launcher . note : if you are using the new launcher with an older version of minecraft , then the mods you are using may attempt to access files in the bin folder directly . if this is the case , you can simply create a folder named ' bin ' in the . minecraft folder where they are looking for it , and add the files the mod needs in there . the mod should find the files , and carry on as it used to , not knowing the difference .

there is ! simply left click the stack you want to split to pick it up , and then right click the bank slot , inventory slot , or assembly slot , in which you want to drop one of the item in question . when you are finished , simply left click the inventory slot you had like to place the remainder of the stack . alternately , in the specific case of assembly , you can drop the entire remaining stack on the last slot of the assembly window . assembling your item will only use one item from the stack , and you can simply use the ' quick return ' button to return the stack to your inventory .
when opening up locked boxes inside armored cars in the new dlc heists , there is a chance that one of the boxes will contain intel . picking up this intel item will unlock a subsequent " train heist " level after you complete your current heist . however , picking up the intel does not unlock the " train heist " level permanently . the intel , when it drops , seems to be placed in the locked box closest to the back doors of the armored transport , so opening the trucks up with c4 will reduce your chances of finding intel .
crime is generally localized to the hold you are in : if you are kill-on-sight in one hold , running to the next hold over should cause the guards to drop pursuit without new guards joining the chase . however , in general , you should always be able to pay the guards , even if they decide to attack you . as soon as they do , sheathe your weapons/spells/shields and hope they trigger the dialogue to allow you to go to jail or pay off your bounty . if they do not , there are a few things you can try to do : as bri and roughneckrage mention , sometimes all you need is time . wait out a few days and see if the situation has not died down by then . the guards will still want you to make reparations , though . an anonymous user mentions that you can try sneaking up to a guard from behind and trigger the dialogue screen to pay off your bounty . stof mentions another possible thing , the bounty collector . the uesp suggests it is not guaranteed , but if he does visit you , you can pay off your bounty for a 20% premium ( and even keep your stolen items ! ) .
sugar cane ( and cactus ) only naturally spawn on chunk generation . sugar cane grows on dirt/grass next to water . the easiest way is to generally walk along a coastline or riverside , and hope you find some . they are not all that rare for the most part . use something like cartograph g to list how many pieces are in your world ; maybe you just have not got any generated yet ? once you have got one though , you will not need to look for any more , they are extremely efficient to farm !
right click the item you want to hold with your right hand and left click the item you want to hold with your left hand . both items must be in your toolbar and they have to be 1-handed items , such as 1-handed swords , axes or flashlights . you can combine any of them freely .
it is a bit of a hassle to set up . before i start , here 's an installer for the end result , if you are willing to trust me . you will only need to rename the vc redist as described at the end of this answer . this installer applies microsoft compatibility shims to remove the " administrator required " flag from the launcher . how to create your own shim database for swtor you will need to use microsoft 's application compatibility toolkit to apply shims to the launcher . first , download and install both the compatibility toolkit and the application verifier . run the compatibility toolkit is standard user analyzer wizard . it is located in start menu > microsoft application compatibility toolkit > developer and tester tools enter the location ( or browse for ) the launcher . it should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\BioWare\Star Wars-The Old Republic click launch very important : you should see 2 lua prompts : the first for the standard user analyser and the second for the swtor launcher . accept the first but decline the second . the analyser will ask whether the application ran without problems . the launcher should not have launched ( if it did , you may have accepted the lua prompt i said to decline earlier ) . click no the analyser will suggest some mitigations . you should only need ForceAdminAccess* , but if it does not work , you can check them all ; it will only loosen some security in a few extremely specific folders/registry keys . that should not cause any problem in an environment that allows you to play swtor . click " launch " to test the settings . the launcher should have launched properly without any prompts . if it did not , click no and select somemore mitigations in step 7 . once the launcher works properly , click yes then export to create an msi file containing your fixes . run the generated msi to install the shims permanently . there is one last step to take care of every last prompt . in the extras folder of your swtor installation ( so C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\BioWare\Star Wars-The Old Republic\extras ) , there should be a file named vc2008redist_x86.exe . rename it to vc2008redist_x86.exe.unused * despite the name , ForceAdminAccess does not automatically grant admin access as if you accepted the lua prompt . it simply lies to the launcher when it asks whether you are an admin .
improved flow first you must understand that the missing link dlc and original game were treated as separate games in your steam library . however director cut combines them both into a single game so that it has better flow and feels more natural with the story . generally , you could have missed the point where it was " logical " to play the dlc since its at a specific point in the story . multiple games displaying instead of merge in steam library you will end up having 3 games in total because of this ( assuming you have deus ex human revolution and the dlc before buying director cut . ) it will display in your library with ( deus ex human revolution , deus ex human revolution director cut , deus ex human revolution : missing link ) price discount on steam they will also slash the price of it from 20 to 10 if you own original game . if you own dlc on top of that it goes from 10 to 5 dollars . features the director 's cut has the following new features new game+ ( only augmentations carry over ) improved textures reworked bosses 45 minute documentary around 8 hours of commentary from eidos montreal can have two energy cell recharge by default on all but the hardest difficulty players can now use jensen’s augmentation powers more freely reworked bosses now remember that the reworked bosses is incredibly important for this dlc and the main selling point for many fans . the reason the deus ex human revolution bosses were unfaithful to the original source was that the game itself was outsourced to another company to create the boss battles so it did not really follow as close to the other work done on the game as it should have . leading to the bosses being more like a generic fps instead of having multiple viable options based on how you developed your character . they did not add ways to avoid bosses completely however they have given you various options on how to deal with them depending on how you progressed with your character . hacking is now a viable way to deal with bosses boss 1 example : hacking the computer enabled me to enter a new room in which i found more weapons and some sentries . i proceeded to hack into the other room in order to gain access to computer and enabled the sentries to fire when boss was in range . i invested a point into being able to lift heavy items so i could pick up the sentry gun and move them into enemy range . boss 2 example : i hacked the doors to get to the roof . there were valves everywhere that enabled poison gas on the first floor and a computer that was surrounded by lasers . i hacked a panel to turn off the lasers and used the computer to enable the sentry guns to fire on the boss . the boss fled to the ground floor after sentries gunned her down and i finished her off with the valve that unleashed poison . deus ex human revolution director cut is worth it for fans if you are a fan of deus ex human revolution who really wanted to do full stealth but was unable to because of how bosses were forced events on you , i highly recommend grabbing this since it allows you to truly build your character without having to deal with consequences as a result of inconsistent design . additional asked questions 1 ) does it add a dc entry as an additional steam game or just merge the de and missing link entry ? i pointed out in my second paragraph it does not merge the deus ex human revolution and missing link entrys . 2 ) if the latter : does it take over the achievements ? as a result of being treated as a separate game it will not take over your achievements . in fact since the game has both missing link and the original as one game , you can actually earn achievements from both games in the director cut edition . achievements missing link = 10 deus ex human revolution = 49 missing link + deus ex human revolution = 59 achivements in director cut since all three are treated as " seperate games " you get missing link + deus ex human revolution + deus ex human revolution director cut 10 + 49 + 59 = 118 achievements in total . sources : http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/09/19/deus-ex-hrs-boss-fights-were-outsourced/ http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/square-enix-details-all-changes-in-deus-ex-human-revolution-director%e2%80%99s-cut.452926875/

they are kind of like the paintings from assassin 's creed ii and brotherhood : there is no real in-game point to them beyond filling up a room at the hideout . you can not read them or interact with them in any way other than getting some information about the book and its author . you do get an achievement for buying all the books from every city and doing the niccolo polo book missions , but that is about it .
please follow the guide provided in askubuntu to correctly configure and install wine which i made for cases like this . after doing so then you can see in the wine appdb for rogue legacy the components needed for it which i also worked on . there is no additional steps apart from using the correct updated/configured wine version and installing the needed components which , as you mentioned are the .netframework and/or mono 2.10 . after running winetricks ( the gui window ) should show you that you have mono installed ( and any other additional components . you can see which you need in the askubuntu answer i provided ) . additionally , and aside from the above mentioned , when running a windows executable app with wine , you should know 3 things : some apps do not execute if the executable file is not in the same folder where you are actually executing wine . for example : wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Rogue\ Legacy/RogueLegacy.exe  will not work but cd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Rogue\ Legacy wine RogueLegacy.exe  will work . when adding the location of a windows executable and it contains names with spaces in them , it is always better to double quote the location than it is to simply assume it will work . for example the above can work better like this : wine ~/.wine/drive_c/"Program Files (x86)/Rogue Legacy"/RogueLegacy.exe  some games do not play well on a 64 bit environment . since i see you have " program files ( x86 ) with you , this just means you have ubuntu 64 bit and simply installed wine which by default takes the arch type of the host system , in your case 64 bit . please see the guide for wine which talks about this . so with this 3 points in mind and the guides , you should have a nice play of , not only this game but many many others .
typically the conversation in which you are told to find mr . smith will also give you some information about where to find him . conversations are also recorded in the journal , so you can always go and look there if you were not paying attention as they took place . in some cases , being on the right step of a quest will also add a dialogue option where you can ask folk for mr . smith 's whereabouts . if you just can not find the bugger , do not worry too much and just go explore a bit , you might just bump into him , or something else to distract you . in some cases quests stretch across multiple cities and it'll be a long time before you find who you are looking for .
hitting airborne targets is hard . there are three main points you need to take into consideration when shooting airborne targets . the distance between you and the target . the velocity and trajectory of the projectile . the velocity and trajectory of the target . becoming an expert at those three points and doing all the calculations in your head is a difficult task for experienced players . however , most experienced players do not calculate all three of these points to make a shot - instead , they try to : minimize the impact of a variable to gain an advantage . distance between you and the target generally speaking , the closer you are to the target , the easier it is to hit them . knowing the distance between you and the target is important . some distances are just too far to accurately hit an opponent in the air . some effective methods you can accurately estimate the distance between you and the target are : the size of the target ( the smaller it is the further away it is ) and landmarks/popular places ( ammo/health kits spawn locations and map objectives ) . knowing the distance between yourself and the target mostly comes from experience ; there is no hard or fast rule to know the precise distance between you and your target . velocity and trajectory of the projectile in general , the faster and straighter a projectile fires , the easier it is to hit a target . using weapons like the direct hit with its whopping 80% faster than regular rockets and straight line trajectory is probably one of the easiest weapons in the game to hit people in the air with . a good way to practice with your weapon is to find an object and guess : how long it will take for the weapon to hit the object . try to make a mental picture of the trajectory it will take . do this a few times each day for different areas , on different maps , for different distances until you can accurately predict what will happen . you should get comfortable with your weapon to the point it is second nature . if you know exactly how your weapon will perform , it is one less thing you need to think about . the velocity and trajectory of the target the easiest time to hit a player in the air is when they stop moving vertically . try to time your shot so it hits the player when they are at the apex of their trajectory . if you launch a player into the air look at how much damage the player received . the amount and location of damage the player took will directly translate to their velocity and trajectory . you can easily practice this against stationary bots .
edit : after showing this off to a friend in multiplayer , he pointed out to me how ridiculous it is to use a ( potentially rare ) statue for this when mannequins cost just 20 wood and stack perfectly well , so you can carry several in case you lose one . okay , i have been poking it for a while , and have come up with a way to destroy any amount of water with just two items ! this method does require you either tunnel around to get underneath the body of water you want to drain or stand in it while working , but it is still often faster than the old fill/dig method . all you need is a mannequin ( possibly other furniture as well , but something 2 blocks wide worked best in my tests ) and a bucket of lava : dig a 2 by 3 hole underneath — but not connecting to — the body of water . place the mannequin in the hole , then drop the bucket of lava into it . wait for the lava to settle . dig a channel from the water to your lava hole and watch the water vanish ! 1 dig out one of the blocks supporting your mannequin 2 and wait for the lava to settle . pick your lava back up . sadly , you can not reverse the process to destroy large amounts of lava — the lava will happily hover above the water , never making contact , forming obsidian , or being destroyed . worse , attempting to pick up this glitch lava will destroy your bucket ! 1 the water vanishes because , when falling into lava , it should make obsidian . however , the mannequin prevents the obsidian from being formed ( as they would occupy the same space ) and the water is simply removed because it has no place to pool . 2 if you are not close enough to your mannequin chamber before breaking this block , the mannequin may fall in the lava and be destroyed . bring spares !
you can use a scroll of fire to enchant a fire sword , which does a small amount of additional damage . you can use a health potion to enchant a life sword , which awards you some health back on hit . you can use an imp invocation scroll to enchant a sword of summoning , which has a chance when you kill an opponent to summon a friendly minion in it is place , which can act as a meat shield to protect you and kill enemies . which you use is primarily a matter of style . the summoning sword is clearly better against a number of trash mob types , but it tends to fall flat against bosses or other foes with high hp . the life sword offers longevity , but you lose some offensive punch , etc .
this is a quirk in how the shops work ; the displays rotate every day , but they will not rotate to an item you have already purchased . this means that the day after you buy them out , their stock will remain the same forever . confusingly , stock will not always rotate to the next new item , however . certain items show up on certain days . so if you do not stop in on the day that the new item appears , it may appear a store is completely sold out . best way to see if you are missing anything is simply to check out this list by serebii and compare what you own . a store that has had no new products for days may suddenly have a new item if you check on the day an item you are missing comes in stock .
you either need control of the air or a bunch more tanks than him to break it . i find it useful to click on his tanks to see their range just before i move mine , so i can be sure to get as close as possible without taking damage . unless the tank numbers are very different between you and your opponent , usually the one who walks into the tank fire loses . whenever i see someone massing siege tanks , i immediately start thinking about what i can do to get him to unsiege and give up his position . things that have worked for me : nukes ! drop a nuke , if he moves out just move in and siege up ( ideally in range of a command center ) , otherwise let the nuke do it is work . you will probably have to get cloak for this to work . get a tech lab on the starport . banshees and bc 's are great when he is playing defensive with tanks . drop marines or marauders one by one in the middle of his tank ball . friendly fire is brutal . also remember that even though his tank line holds his position well , he is likely not defending all of his structures . peek around to see if you can blow up some supply depots or a risky expansion . also , i am not plat+ like you suggested , so consider the source : )
found out the answer ! sometimes when you kill enemies they are blasted into tiny parts . when your attacks inflict lightning damage , arcs of lightning will appear between these parts . if the parts fly high and wide , this can create a chain-lightning-tyle effect ; but it is purely cosmetic .
seemingly they cannot - it has been requested to allow them to be repeatable once every six months/one year but i can not find any communication from ccp that states they have implemented this as a change . unlike the epic arc missions , once you have done a set of cosmos missions you will not be able to repeat them . this is further clarified on the eve wiki : most of these missions can only be completed once during your character 's lifetime . and . . . warning : do not fail , quit , decline or let mission offer expire . it could lock you out from accessing other cosmos agents .
there is no way to reset all quest progress without save file tampering ( and to my knowledge there are not useful save file editors for that yet ) . you can however reset badass challenge progress after receiving something like 80% of the challenges . pretty much the best option you can have is to join the game of a host who has not completed the game and you can run through the missions again . you will not receive any rewards for missions you have already completed though . it is also not something that is easy to set up spontaneously .
given the square nature of the missing pieces , i think it is some kind of chunk error ( "chunk " being the term for any given sector in the minecraft world ) . specifically , from the notes about patch 1.2_01 on notch 's blog , emphasis mine : added a temporary fix to get rid of chunk visibility errors the last one is interesting . . the problem with chunk visibility errors was that for some reason the “dirty” flag on chunks and the list of “dirty chunks” got out of synch . there wasn’t time to try to do a proper fix today , so i just made the client check a couple of dirty chunks per frame to make sure they’re in the list . so until we fix it proper , you might get invisible chunks , but they will fix themselves after a second or two , usually way before you even get close to them .
there is no way to choose the city you want to join . well , there is , and it is hero-only . here 's what you can do : you either join one of the cities randomly and the city happens to be an advanced one , or you are in a coalition with an hero , the hero chooses to join a suitably empty advanced city and as a result " drags " the coalition in with him . you do not need to have 100 sp for the second scenario . this has changed . as soon as a player amasses more than 100 soul points , all future lives will begin in towns inhabited by players who also have over 100 points ( allowing the best players to play together ) . the official die2nite help page
expeditions is a very important part of d2n : it allows people , not to get trapped by zombies , and not have to waste ap , to go rescue them . it allows for more communication , so not everyone runs off to the first undepleted zone and , it allows for way better planing of a route , than on the town forums . the most important things to do , while planning an expedition is : be aware of zombie counts , never go in to zones , you cant get back from . if you are unsure how many zombies there are in the zone , either have a large enough group of people , or have a scout ( hero type ) to scout out the zones you are going to . always try to maximize the route you are going , by going through as many undepleted zones as possible . and , always have a list of what resources you need to most that day . only bring back the most scarce resources . the point of expeditions , is to deplete the most zones you can . always try to go as far out of town as possible , so you can let those lone scavengers , to take the zones that are more safe , and closer to the town . if you find yourself with zones that have huge amount of zombies , bring some weapons , and start killing them . ( note : this will be much easier accomplished , if you have plumbing built . which allows you to refill water weapons for free . ) i will also recommend building , and upgrading the watchtower two levels , as it will give you the exact number of zombies six zones off the town . this makes expeditions a lot easier to plan , and execute . as stated , you find yourself depleting a zone too fast . this can be solved , by making a group , of active and flexible people . start by going out right after the attack , and stop at the first undepleted zone , and dig until its depleted , then move on the next zone . if possible , you can even split the group up ( not recommended , unless there is no zombies in the zones you are going to , as weapons take up much inventory space . ) , and get more searches done , when you sleep . i would say that the most important thing of expeditions , is communication . always communicate with your group , the best you can . either over a chat room , messenger or whatever works for you and your group . always try to stick to a zone , until it is depleted , and then move on to the next zone . with a flexible group , you should be able to deplete the entire rout for your expedition . as for buildings , they are very important to find , as there are only ten buildings on the map , and these contains the most scarce resources . if you have a scout in your town , you should always let them try to scout out the buildings , as you never know how much zombies are there .
it is absolutely worth it to get better equipment in warzones . bolstering ( the name of the mechanic that scales your stats ) does two things . it scales the skills you have to their level 50 versions , if they scale with level . it modifies some of your current stats , primary stats , health , damage , etc . to level 50 , based solely on your level . this is a multiplicative scalar , not an additive one . for example ( with made up numbers ) : suppose at level 10 you have 100 base strength . at level 50 , you have 500 base strength . the bolster system would apply a 5 times multiplier to your current strength , so if you only have a total of +10 from gear , you end up with 550 str . however , if you keep yourself in purples , and have +40 str , you would end up at 700 str instead . this essentially means that your gear " scales " right alongside your level , and if you are in all purples , you could have higher stats than a non-bolstered person in greens/blues . bolster does not give you new skills , nor ability points to spend in your advanced class trees . also , unless you buy pvp-specific gear , you do not get expertise , which makes a huge difference .
i just recently started playing swtor as a f2p player . my experience so far has shown that as long as i complete all the side quests and heroics , i am usually a level or two higher than my current quests . not much , to be sure , but it is enough to give me the edge i need , and i play a tank jedi guardian , solo except for the heroics . i do not pvp at all , so that is definitely not it . i run the flashpoints once , mostly to see the content , but that is definitely a good way to pick up good gear if they run it multiple times when they are eligible for it . f2p players can do the heroics multiple times , so if they do not mind grouping , that would also be a good way to gain experience and potential gear upgrades . if your friends are unable to beat a boss at the end of a sidequest , that means they may be focusing on the wrong aspects of a fight , or bringing the wrong companion with them to complement their playstyle . they should also be keeping up with their equipment ; quest rewards are important to keep you at the proper power level , and spend those commendations before you leave the planet entirely . modded gear has a bit more complexity , but make sure your armoring , and hilt/barrels are the best you can get ; they are what determine armor and damage .
correct , you can hit the ps button to exit , but that is it . xbox users can hit the xbox button . for consoles , this has been a heavily requested feature for multiple versions of the franchise , but a proper way to exit between rounds has never been provided . pc users can force the game closed , or hit esc after the stats presentation to get an " exit game " prompt .
make sure there are dwarves with the cleaning labor enabled . they will only clean smoothed , engraved or built floors . walls will be cleaned automagically if an adjacent floor tile is cleaned , but not otherwise . there is no way to tell dwarves to clean , so it is very much a waiting game . if they are tracking the mud all over the place you may want to designate the muddy tiles as restricted traffic zones , to minimize its spread ( this may be more valuable when dealing with pools of rectum-dissolving demon blood ) . flowing water can displace most contaminants , moving them out of the way , and pumping water purifies it . admittedly , this is not going to do much to help with mud , which is made by water . if the tile is made of natural stone , you can also construct a floor over it , getting a clean floor ( thanks to stuart pegg for testing ) . also , outside tiles may be cleaned of contaminants on season change ( at least it did in earlier version ) , so you may wish to simply knock the roof through . the added benefit of having a sunlit dining room is that it will prevent cave adaptation ( though , if they already have cave adaptation , it will cause them to drop barfs all over the place for a while , which may seem counterintuitive ) .
avoiding the bug about the forsworn conspiracy quest : followers may get permanently stuck in the shrine of talos , regardless of if the quest is completed and you escaped from cidhna mine . if this happens , the follower will not leave even after you tell them to go home , and if they are moved elsewhere via console , they will walk back to the shrine of talos , no matter where in skyrim they are . from : uesp wiki , " the forsworn conspiracy - bugs " i would recommend not having a follower while doing this quest to avoid them getting stuck in the shrine of talos . or you could ask them to wait outside the shrine . multiple backup saves are also recommended . fixing the bug if you have already encountered the bug and can not load a previous save , try these*: try the enable and disable console commands . make a save game first , and then in the game , open up the console by pressing ~ , then click on your follower ( in op 's case , aela ) . aela 's refid ( 0001a697 ) should show up in the screen . if the refid is correct ( meaning you have selected aela correctly , and not another object ) , type disable and then enable in the console . this should ' reset ' her . if aela is not near your location , you can still select her by entering the console command prid 1A697 , after that type disable and then enable . then try the moveto player command ( which moves that prid-targetted entity near the vicinity of the player ) and see if she gets ' reset ' and decides to stop her pilgrimage to the shrine of talos . if it still does not work , try finishing the forsworn conspiracy quest and the next quest that it will trigger , no one escapes cidhna mine . see if your follower will now follow you . ( i know op has already posted a solution that worked for them . just posting alternative solutions in case someone else experiences a similar issue . )
you gain only one daily quest , but you can have up to 3 quests at the same time ( source ) . note that you can abandon up to 1 quest a day and receive immediately another random one in its place .
you will get a lot of gear through the initial stages of questing that will increase your item level , this is the quickest ' cheap ' way to achieve the required item level to enter these dungeons . the quickest ' overall ' method of getting higher level gear would be through using the auction house , although other options include levelling the tailoring profession and using that to create cloth gear for questing/dungeons . depending on the gear that you had in cataclysm , you should be able to enter the initial temple of the jade serpent and stormstout brewery instances straight away but if you do not meet the requirement for these then the upgrades you get from the initial quest chain in jade forest should dramatically increase your item level quite quickly . average item level is calculated by taking the item level of each item you have equipped and dividing it by the number of equipment slots excluding the tabard and shirt slots . in the instance of using a two handed weapon , the off hand weapon slot is not included in the calculation . however , in the instance where you have a ' required ' slot empty ( ie : head slot or shoulder slot ) this slot is still included in the calculation but with an item level of 0 when summing up the item level of that slot . this means that a fully equipped character using two one hand weapons has sixteen item slots while a character using a two hand weapon has fifteen item slots .
land value and happiness are separate concepts . land value aka desirability encourage wealthier sims to move in . happiness encourages density increases . residential happiness comes from shopping ! turn on the commercial dataview and make sure that shoppers can go from residential zones to commercial zones with available goods . ( goods resupply automatically at 6 am and 6 pm . goods have nothing to do with freight ) . residentials without money or without nearby goods will instead go to parks to get happiness . this happiness is just as effective at growing density as shopping ( ie . your buildings will grow ) . however , there are some downsides . parks cost you money , while commercial buildings pay tax . parks take up more space to get the equivalent capacity of commercial buildings . parks also increase land value - so you may accidentally bring in wealthier sims than you really want ( wealthy buildings hold fewer people ) . if you need more jobs , you might need denser industrial zones . industrial happiness comes from making shipments of freight . turn on the industrial view . if there is a large pile of shipments at any building , that industrial is in trouble . make more commercial zones or trade buildings to receive those shipments . once received , those shipments will automatically vanish at some point allowing more to be received .
i found the generic gestures to mimic real life movement lacking when scaled up for the move . i played heavy rain when it came out on a dualshock and enjoyed it . when i started a new game using the move and i found the move controller input to be lacking . i only played until your wife and kids come home but i did not enjoy the required arm sweeping and wrist flicking . what was a flick of your thumb becomes a whole arm movement . there is probably a lot of room for your personal tastes to affect your opinion of this experience .
only works if the target is visible per this .
as far as i know all ps3 games are infact region free . the same cannot be said about blu-ray movies though . source 1 source 2 source 3 and of course there is this question as pointed out by colin . however most of these are only forum posts . if i get chance will have a good search for some concrete evidence from sony . happy gaming : )
so this is a bit of an interesting issue . to answer this , we need to take a closer look at the damage formula : base damage = &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; ( weapon damage range + bonus damage from gear ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &times ; bonus from primary attribute &dagger ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &times ; other class bonuses from skills . ability damage = &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; base damage ( as above ) &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &times ; % weapon damage listed on the ability . &dagger ; 1 primary attribute = +1% bonus damage for the purpose of this question , we can ignore ability damage and bonuses from skills . understanding the formula base damage has two main components . weapon damage ( this is the range you get , i.e. 4-6 for many starting weapons ) and primary attribute bonus ( this is 1% for every primary stat you ahve . in your case , intelligence ) . because they are being multiplied , a small weapon range gets less benefit than a large one . 4-6 damage times 200% damage ( from 100 intelligence ) is only 8-12 , whereas a weapon with 6-10 goes up to 12-20 . the higher your weapon 's average damage , the more valuable the bonus from stats is . applying our findings in your case , you have got a ton of intelligence , which is great , and a really low damage weapon , which is less great . this means that really low damage is getting multiplied by a large value , which is still , unfortunately , in your case , a really low final value . the take away here is that primary stat is not worth more than weapon damage . you need both to maximize your damage , which means you had probably be best served by dropping your 20 dps weapon and picking up something nicer . as a comparison - my wizard has a 33 dps weapon , and she is only in act iii of normal .
the sabre launcher will automatically lock-on and acquire targets while equipped . the weapon can be used on opponents while they are either in vehicles or freely traversing the playing field . targets can be acquired rapidly , however only one target can be assessed at a time . the following conditions are required to begin locking onto your target . the opponent must be within range of the targeting system . ( there is a minimum firing distance ) must be in-air . or in simpler terms , not touching the ground . ( this does not apply to ground vehicles ) at or near the area of your crosshairs . ( zooming helps ) once these conditions have been met a box will appear around your target . this will also be indicated by a distinct beeping sound . let 's call this the " pre-firing " state . during this state the three conditions listed above must be maintained at all times . after a period of ~5 seconds in this state , the targeting box will become red . at this point you have reached the " firing-state " . left-clicking will now fire the sabre rocket . during the pre-firing state your opponent will be aware that you are targeting him . this is accomplished by both a continuous beeping sound and a hud message . if your opponent is not in a vehicle this will often prompt the player to land on the ground as soon as possible to disable your ability to track him . as a result , the best strategy is often to click rapidly in anticipation of the firing-state . once the missile is fired , your opponent will again be notified of this action in their hud by both a message and a visual indicator showing the missile 's trajectory . at this point they can take two actions . . move into a position where there is an obstacle between them and the current path of the missile . wait until the missile becomes within range and attempt to fire at it in an effort to disable it . in consideration of the weapon 's strengths and weaknesses , the sabre launcher is best suited to be most effective against enemy vehicles and fast moving ( and often high flying ) enemy flag cappers .
from the dragonvale wikia : to breed a gold dragon , it has been established that the elements metal and fire must be present . this means many combinations are possible . the gold dragon can be bred at either the breeding cave/epic breeding island . it goes on to say that the breeding time is 48 hours , or 38 hours and 24 minutes in an upgraded breeding cave/island . you must , however , be at least level 17 before you are able to breed the gold dragon . note : level 17 is your required level , not the required level of your dragons .
to run a game from a disk image in a supported format ( . bin , . iso , . img , . ccd , . mds , . pbp , . ecm ) , click on File -> Run ISO in the main program window and select the image . to run a disk image in an unsupported format , you will need to mount it with a separate program and configure epsxe to use the virtual drive which the image is mounted to ( Config -> Cdrom -> Configure ) .
what you are referring to is a strange mood ! a strange mood happens every so often when you have more than 20 dwarves , and can add an artifact to your fort , providing a peerless ( or useless , depending on material ) weapon , a sublime build-able option , or " fortress wealth fodder " if the artifact is not build-able , wearable , or usable . specifically , possessions , despite the advent of ghosts and other haunts , are only notable for the fact that the artifact is the only result of them -- unlike any of the other strange moods , they do not result in skill increase as fey or secretive moods do ( enough experience to instantly push dwarves into legendary skill , possibly even up to legendary+5 , the maximum skill level ) . dwarves usually build their artifacts out of favored materials and into favored objects -- perhaps you will find that the dwarf in question is fond of amulets ?
split-screen pc/mac play is not supported by valve via obvious in-game menus . the only way in which you can play co-op portal 2 with a single portal 2 purchase in a way that is obviously supported by the game manufacturer is by purchasing the ps3 copy : only playstation®3 split-screen co-op can be played using a single copy of the game . when you purchase a new copy of portal 2 for playstation®3 , you will receive an in-box code which provides your linked steam account with access to your copy of portal 2 on your computer . the game is still owned by only a single steam account--another copy will be required to play online co-op with a friend . ( source ) it has been noted in the other answers that the act of single-system split-screen is possible . it required modifying configuration files and a workaround to force the game to move a controller to the second player slot . valve has neither stated that this method is supported or banned . steam support indicates it is not supported , but also openly admits it is an option that currently exists . hello shaun , thank you for contacting steam support . split-screen mode is available in the xbox 360 and playstation 3 versions of this game only . however , split-screen options may be available using the methods found here : http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1847904 note : these methods are not supported , as split-screen is not an intended feature of the pc/mac version of portal 2 . if you have any further questions , please let us know - we will be happy to assist you .

okay , so i did a few experiments in the past few days , and i will post what i found and what i did not . for reference , when i say " adjacent tiles " i mean the three tiles above , the three tiles below and the two tiles on each side of the bush . you can plant bushes alone in the village . by that i mean that you can plant bushes anywhere in the main village if all its adjacent tiles are free . you cannot plant bushes on the beach . the two attempts at doing so have failed , so i conclude that it can not be done . you can plant bushes next to each other . i have attempted to plant a row of bushes , as well as three bushes in an l pattern , and both attempts succeeded . i do not know if you can plant a square of bushes ( 4 or 9 or + bushes ) , but i have no reason to think you cannot . i did not do the test because i ran out of bushes , but if i can i will test this and update this answer . you can plant bushes next to a tree . an attempt at planting a bush right next to a tree succeeded , so i conclude that it can be done . you cannot plant bushes adjacent to a river tile . i planted a bush next to a straight river going north-south , and it would not grow . you cannot plant bushes adjacent to a cliff . self-explanatory . you cannot plant bushes adjacent to a building or a public works project . in my opinion this is the most important test . i planted a bush at the following four locations : next to my house , next to re-tail 's , directly above a lamppost and above-left the same lamppost ( so left of the previous bush ) . all of these wilted . my conclusion is that you cannot plant bushes adjacent to a building or a public works project . note : this last test cost me upwards 40'000 bells and 4 days to build/remove the lamppost and obtain the bushes . i strongly advise against attempting to reproduce this experiment due to the cost in time/money . bushes can grow in a connection of 12 at most . this includes trees and stumps , vertically , horizontally , and diagonally . if a bush or a tree is planted near a sequence of twelve bushes/trees/stumps touching each other , that thirteenth sapling will not grow . other than these i have not seen any limitations in where to plant bushes . obviously since you need to dig a hole in order to plant a bush , you cannot plant a bush anywhere you cannot dig a hole ( maybe i should've added that above , but oh well ) . hope this helps !
you do not get anything back and are not allowed to do any other mission until you complete the escape mission . you can still view the starchart and chat with people , attempting to do another mission will force you to complete the escape mission first .
loot drops for you only off of those monsters that die within a certain distance of your character . bashiok ( diablo 3 cm ) confirms this with a tweet ( link ) .
some dynamic events start up by themselves either periodically or when players are near , while others require a player to speak to an npc to kick them off . in this case , i believe the event should start up by itself , but , since it is bugged , the event can " get stuck " ( brugh just stands around and tells you to " stay on your guard " despite nothing happening ) and you will not be able to restore the spiral to its " fixed " state . this gw2 forum thread and this one seem to indicate that the problem has existed for quite a while . despite a note in the 2012-11-15 game update claiming that it has been fixed , that does not seem to be the case . for what it is worth , it is still possible to climb up the spiral when it is in the " damaged " state - it is just a little harder and not so obvious to tell where you have to jump from the wilted leaves onto the rock , but it can be done . ( i suspect you may not get the achievement , at least for the first jumping puzzle - my guess would be you can still go and complete the second jumping puzzle achievement , but i have not confirmed this . ) please also note that the comment in the first forum thread i linked to about being unable to get the skill point is incorrect - you do not have to complete the jumping puzzle for this , you just have to interact with the skill point at the bottom of the spiral to obtain morgan 's orchid , which you can do irrespective of the spiral 's state . consuming this orchid will give you the skill point .
the vanilla server is exactly what it is and has no features to prevent these wallhacks and exploits . your only tools in vanilla are player bans and kicks after people misbehave , or using the whitelist . to automatically prevent or even detect these exploits you need to be running a modified server . there are many , many anti-cheat plugins for bukkit , for example .
the combat effectiveness of your crew varies , and additionally they level up as they fight . for instance , engi and zoltan crew members have lower health than humans , slugs , mantis , or rock crew members . mantis crew also have a bonus to combat damage . engi and zoltan especially are worthless in a fight - be ready to move them quickly , and plan on any combat taking a while if you can not get the enemies into the medbay quickly . i tend to assign at least one , but ideally two of my crew members to " security detail " - they are the ones that get pulled into rooms to fight if there are enemy boarders . they are also typically my away team if i have a teleporter . i will tend to pick mantis first for this , then rock , and finally human . if i have got to double up and have my subsystem crew work security detail , i tend to leave the weapon officer and pilot alone - other crewmates will pull security detail before i will move them . some other tips : as has been noted , the best place to fight is in your medbay , as you will constantly regenerate health so long as the medbay is undamaged and powered up . i will sometimes open doors to route enemies into 2-square rooms , or let them have a particular subsystem ( ie , sensors or door control ) if they are likely to move into a more advantageous room after they have damaged it . remember that you can pause ( with space ) and issue orders - if you need to shuffle crew around , and you have got a lot going on between ship combat and dealing with boarders , this can save your crew , especially if you are like me and you tend to click doors rather than crew in a panic . in combat , you will still take damage as long as you are in the room with the enemy , so make sure you leave enough health on your crew to make it out of the room before they die . if you have decompressed part of the ship , remember that you will take damage passing through it , so keep that in mind as well if the decompressed portions of the ship are between your crew and the medbay . upgrade doors will help a lot , giving you more time to " vent " them to death or time for you to finish the fight with the ship before taking care of the boarders . just remember robots do not need oxygen and if your door controls get destroyed you can not close doors , which means you could lose oxygen .
i have heard that sometimes alicia 's house is only available during the quest uninvited guests and there is a skull drop off and skull pick up there . also when you arrive at the prison there are quite a few and they have to be found before the game is complete . but if you ever find yourself missing one you can always join someone else 's game because it saves the certain ids and collectables you already have and do not .
the new character james vega , is voiced by celebrity freddie prinze jr . it appears that all major voice talent returns except for mordin solus , assuming those characters even have a part in your shepard 's story . mordin solus was voiced by michael beattie in me2 . i am not sure who they used to recast in me3 , but the part is not listed on imdb , despite the character being fully voiced in the game . it has been confirmed to be a different actor though . the imdb page listing the cast is located here : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839558/fullcredits#cast mark meer voices mordin in me3 . he was used as a placeholder in expo demos etc whilst they tried to recast beattie , but they eventually went with meer .

oops , it looks like i got the rooms mixed up . so the generator you are talking about is the one that is next to the room where you had to push a block on a switch to keep the windows open . these windows you could climb up out of . the one on the left has a ladder going down and the one on the right should give you access to the dinghy . to get to the generator , you need to shift time to the present to disable those beams . however , you needed to be in the past to get to the room in the first place . you need to shift back to the present from there . how do you do it ? well you need to lower the dinghy so you can reach the deck and hit the crystal . from that room , it would be easier to just climb out the window with the ladder , go down and and look toward the other window and up at the deck . you should see the dinghy there with a target to hit . hitting it will lower/raise it . after you had lowered it , you can return and climb onto it and hit the target again to raise you to the deck . from there , shoot the time crystal to shift to the present . then you could return to that room using the dinghy and to the generator . now you need to shift back to the past again so you can activate the generator . fortunately there is a grate above with a clear view to the time crystal . shoot it so you can shift to the past and finally activate the generator . to get to the second generator ( the one in the south ) , start off from the first generator . you will notice that the room across the hall on the left has a fan in there . if you are in the past ( everything is colorful and operational ) , the fan should be spinning . inside that room , you should see a blue switch that you had have to shoot at . you cannot shoot through the fan when it is off so you need to go to the present ( where everything is dull and not working ) and shoot it then . that should open the door to enter the room ( iirc ) . in the room there should be a switch on your left and bars on the right looking into the next room with a box sitting on a platform . the switch opens a hatch that covers a target that you have to shoot at however you do not have a direct line of sight to it since the box is in the way . you will need to move the box over so you have access to the fan behind it . you need to open that hatch and shoot at the target . with the box out of the way ( and the fan off ) , you should be able to do so . it should open the gate leading to that room . now you have access to the generator so you just have to go back into the past where it is operational and turn it on . you can access the crystal back in the room with the previous generator .
the corruption/crimson spreads much more easily in hardmode , with the hallow spreading in a similar fashion . corruption , crimson and hallow will spread to stone , sand , ice and dirt that are up to three tiles away . almost all other blocks are immune to corruption and hallow , including wood , clay blocks , ash blocks , silt blocks , obsidian , ores , gems , and all bricks ( except pearlstone , which will spread hallow ) . corruption and crimson can convert mud blocks into dirt over time . mud blocks containing mushroom grass are not affected . sunflowers will no longer prevent the spread of corruption . instead , they will pop out of the ground as corruption spreads past . hallow and corruption cannot convert each other . there are no longer enemies that spread corruption , crimson , or hallow . so , what you need is a 4 tile barrier made of pretty much anything besides stone , sand , ice or dirt . the favored method is by making a quarantine tunnel all the way around you base . my preferred method is as follows : start with a 4 block wide tunnel . you can use the ruler if you are super paranoid . while that tunnel itself is perfectly fine for hardmode protection , i like to line my tunnels with some type of brick . this has multiple advantages such as thorns no growing in your tunnel ( since the corruption can not spread over the bricks themselves ) , it looks nice and clean , and most importantly , it is a visual reminder to you and other players not to build there . keep in mind that these bricks are in addition to the 4 air tiles now just continue with this tunnel all around you base . give yourself plenty of room so you can keep your farms within the quarantine zone and so you do not have those hardmode enemies spawning right at you doorstep .
yes , there is something behind that door . if you want a hint : these runes can be translated into a date .
i got a response over at /r/fnv that seems to have helped . as i said there : " i tried [ verifying the game files ] , and there was one file that did not verify and had to be re-downloaded . the jury 's out on whether this fixed the problem , since it is proof by exhaustion , but i did run 3 other vendors besides gun runners : the guy at mccarran , gun runners at the interstate intersection , and the guy at the crimson caravan , and had no crashes . "
there is a catapult in the first level of the goblin menace , just after you go outside the tavern and do the 3 platforms puzzle . use the lever to operate it .
just figured it out . these gems replenish your magic , which is consumed by abilities other than the tongue . ( fire breath , for example ) . magic regenerates on its own over time , but it is very slow . magic is represented by the green bar in the upper-left corner of the screen , above your health .
you are safe to strip older-tier vessels for parts . the main reason you would not is if you were playing some sort of hybrid class that liked to swap between two vessel types ( escorts and cruisers ) depending on if you were doing pvp or pve combat . even that case is pretty much nullified the moment you can afford to purchase a second ship of the same tier as your main ship ( although i would avoid that until you hit the max tier ) .
it is a substitution cipher . a = 1 , b = 2 , etc . iwillreturnbatman or i will return batman i just listened to it , and the voice is familiar , put i can not put it to a character ( not the riddler , he wants you to know the puzzle is his ) .
if you are dead-set on making due with this embark area , i would dig for the caverns . pretty much just pick a point , and dig straight down . ( if you grabbed the newest release , this has apparently been made easier by allowing designations that span z-levels . ) if you are just digging a small stairway , and not an elaborate ' grand central vein ' as i usually do , it should be relatively fast to hit the caverns . i would suggest having two dwarves dig out two side-by-side up/down stairs . this is more efficient than a single stair because they will not fight over who is digging where/when . once you hit the caverns , the first thing you see is almost always an underground lake . the second thing you almost always see is underground creatures . you may want to just grab a few buckets of water quickly , then floor up your stairs to keep them from surfacing , at least until you have a militia . once you have a fertile farmland , you never need to water it again , and can have infinite booze . you will , however , need water for tending wounded , so it might be worth building a well near the underground cavern . the bucket can drop down from the cavern ceiling , protecting you from all but flying creatures . do not worry if the well is a hike - water is hopefully seldom used after farms are running .
before the 1.7 version , a custom tcp protocol was used , and thus some escaped hexadecimal through a netcat / telnet did worked . today , they use json objects , and a more complex protocol , as implemented on the next link . on the wiki page little python script was linked : https://gist.github.com/barneygale/1209061 . i made this small implementation ( freely inspired from last link ) which prints the json object answered by the minecraft server ( localhost:25565 by default ) downloadable here https://gist.github.com/qolund/6d10c02f331ca8ee047f
this seems to happen when you change your device 's system time . as a result of turning the time forwards , items speed up . turning time backwards makes everything take longer . this concept is found in many games for handheld devices .
as far as i am aware , the umbrella terms for games like these ( including less adventure based games like cookie clicker ) that seems the most popular is incremental games . the best source for these type of games i have seen so far is /r/incremental_games on reddit .
there are several background objects that drop items when you use certain moves : trees - air cutter , twister , blizzard routes 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , ambrette town , cyllage city , azure bay grass - razor leaf , petal blizzard routes 5 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 19 stalagmite - surf , muddy water caves boulder - rock slide caves and routes snowpile - rock slide , hyper voice route 17 ice crystal - rock slide route 17 hardened sand - rock slide route 9 , 18 luminous boulder - rock slide glittering cave sandpile - rock slide , hyper voice route 8 , cyllage city sandpile - heat wave route 8 , 13 , 19 these background objects can all be distinguished by the fact that they are directly behind the opposing pokemon .
in civ v , certain bonus resources are limited in quantity -- iron , coal , aluminum , uranium , and horses . unlike in civ iv where you either had the resource , or you did not , so-called " strategic resources " are a finite quantity -- if you only have one iron mine ( and that iron mine yields a measly 2 iron ) you can only have 2 swordsmen , which are iron-dependent units . if you do not have any more of the resource , you can no longer build units that require it , and if you drop into a deficit of the resource ( due to war , end of a trade agreement , etc . ) all units which require that resource take a hefty combat penalty until you accrue more of it ( or they die , reducing the total draw from your civ 's resources ) .
piloting a crew member who is controlling a helm gains one point of experience for each incoming projectile that is dodged during combat . this includes asteroids , so long as you are in combat at the time . ( note that the dodges do not count while you ship is under the effects of +60% evasion from a cloak . ) this can be explicitly trained by finding an enemy that cannot break through your shields , and letting him fire at you . increasing your dodge chance ( i.e. . more power to engines ) will help this occur quicker , but even with the default chance you can max out the skill eventually . engines exactly as for piloting , a crew member manning the engines gains one point of xp for each projectile evaded while uncloaked in combat - and so it can be trained in the same way . weapons a crew member who is manning the weapons station gains one point of experience for each weapon that is fired . it does not matter whether it hits or misses , or whether it can do damage ( e . g . a beam weapon fired at a shield ) . ( multi-shot weapons such as burst lasers still count as a single fire order and hence a single xp . ) this can be trained by firing non-lethal weapons ( e . g . ones that do ion damage ) repeatedly against a target that cannot damage you . shields a crew member manning the shields station gains one point of experience for each shield " bubble " that is brought back up during combat . it does not matter why the shields were down , be that direct enemy fire , ion damage , asteroid strikes , or even manually removing and then restoring power to the shield systems . this can be trained by letting a target that cannot break through all of your shields repeatedly take one layer down . ( for fastest results , move your pilot away from the helm , or reduce your engines to 0 power . this will reduce your dodge chance to 0% , ensuring that everything hits your shields . ) note that you used to be able to manually remove power and restore it in combat , to get points , but this has been patched . repair a crew member gains one point of experience for getting the " finishing blow " when repairing a ( sub ) system . note that hull breaches provide no repair experience . there is no specific way to train this as it requires your systems to be damaged . though you can focus the xp gains by always having the same person run around and repair everything after a battle . combat a crew member gains one point of experience for getting the finishing blow when fighting an enemy crew member or ( sub ) system . this generally gets trained in " real " situations . however , since xp is gained for taking out systems , a few extra xp can be gained from boarding if one tries to take out the enemy 's systems before the crew .
so there is no good answer to this question , or it would already appear in the larger build order questions on this site . unlike the early game ( which is well defined ) mid to late game does not have an easy answer , and anyone who gives you a bo past 20 is a snake oil sales man . even in the zerg question you linked the answer was : What ever feels best . let 's look at some of the basic protoss builds and how they progress : 4 gate usually this build is very all-in , and you are banking on winning early . however , if you do enough economic damage with a 4 gate , but do not win you can still be at an advantage . at this point if you pressure more you are going to end up against a higher tech opposing force and probably lose , so you can expand here and maybe add on a robo or two more gateways . 3 gate one of the great things people like to do with 3 gate is provide pressure so that they can expand . this sets them up with a nice little force as they transition into the mid game . once expanding there are some people who like to progress to 5 gate + robo , or 3 gate + double robo , or even ( recently ) 3 gate + double starport . there is even a nice 4 gate + robo to provide pressure so that protoss can take a third expansion . you probably notice a number of trends between these two builds , even though i picked two builds that could not be more different there were a number of important ideas : your production must be proportional to your income . if you have less production than your income you need to have a plan for it ( eg . setting up to expand ) . if you have more production than your income you need to be aggressive do not over commit . when you are ahead , your number 1 priority should be to get more ahead ( ie . expand ) while you always need to tech ( ie . red queen hypothesis ) teching takes time , so do not forget that in your calculations . now you will notice that a lot of what is being discussed is income vs production and there are a couple tools you can use to help you out : protoss calculator terran calculator zerg calculator remember : to get good at starcraft you need to get good at execution and decision making , not get good at following a road map .
salary is based on the people that pass your booth and as far as i know it is 5 × customers served . while it is safe to immediately dismiss the red sweater guy with the crayon drawn passports , this is not true in general . sometimes people will not produce papers until asked to . often people will 180° when confronted with speech intent violations . it is faster to dismiss than to detain , so in general you want to avoid going crazy with the jail time . however , one you unlock detaining-based bribes , the detain button becomes an investment - in the time two people are detained you might be able to make one more obvious call like letting a citizen or an ambassador through , but it is tough to do so without risking a citation .
steps : install gameranger join a room together in gameranger . you host the game , and make sure you check the box for " allow late joiners " when you start the game , it should launch borderlands , and your game should jump right to a hosting mode where gameranger starts up a lan game . meanwhile , your friend 's game will launch . if they get stuck at the start screen instead of joining you automatically , have them close borderlands and then launch it again from within steam . gameranger basically sets up a vpn connection between the parties involved , then connects the players via the lan game function . so it can be pretty tricky to get working with various routers , ports , firewalls , etc . source : http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/showthread.php?t=117273
yes . stacking tech armor with fortification or defense matrix will work . it will stack the cooldown penalty also , but if it makes you a walking tank , i guess it is worth it ! http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/tech_armor#player_notes_2
i assume that gems are a random spawn of power ups . you can see i am interested in the spawn rate of power ups myself . given that gems are treated the same as other pick ups , you can increase the chance of spawning them with the " pickup spawn " boost in the " abilities " menu for each character ( when the boost is purchased it is permanent and applies to all characters ) . pickup spawn spawn x% more frequently where x increases in steps the more coins you spend .
speak to faralda at the entrance : first , ask her why she is here . then ask her if you can enter the college . when she asks why , your answer will choose which school of magic you join ( destructive , etc ) she will ask you to perform a test with a certain spell . you probably do not have the spell yet , so buy it . it is going to be about 30 gold . once you buy the spell , if you are roughly level 3 or 4 , you cast the spell at the seal on the floor . she will then lead you to the door of the college herself , no key required .
there is now a bukkit mod for detecting and teleporting to redstone clocks : the sensibly-named redstone clock detector .
there are more options now . starting in patch 1.0.5 , blizzard has been adding recipes that guarantee a particular stat . first came the hellfire rings ( see here for instructions ) . patch 1.0.7 added five new recipes , each of which comes in four variants . each variant comes with a specific primary stat : dexterity , intelligence , strength , or vitality . for the jeweler , there are four amulet variants . that is currently twenty-four recipes with a guaranteed roll of some stat .
ok mate , did some digging : ) it seems like you have to trigger another bug , bursting out of the wall in the hallway that leads to our " stuck-room " . http://www.dumpt.com/img/viewer.php?file=fsfjcxdxdi72rsudqk1s.jpg just put all of your party members straight in front of the wall and end turn , that should trigger it . spoiler ! ! ! : there is also a bug with the final boss , it seems like you have to attack her the very last ! first kill everything she summons and the pillars , and once she resummons them or tries to , she is supposed to run away and trigger a cutscene . ok… the pillar thing is going on endlessly so just do that : do not attack her at all , clean out the pillars she uses , kill the bugs until none respawn , after no bugs respawn , get one more pillar , and than attack her directly , it worked for me ( i did a lot more pillars though ) good luck ! i hope this helps .
he is the winner of the " a life in arkham " ( or " your face in arkham " , not sure ) contest from gamestop , where the first prize was to have your face in the game : pre-order a copy of batman : arkham asylum in any gamestop store between september 8th and october 15th , and you could win a chance to be immortalized inside the infamous arkham asylum . one lucky winner will have his or her face and likeness created as an in-game character , locked inside of arkham asylum for the rest of their days . so he is not a known villain , only a player integrated in the game . this explains also why he seems more detailled , he is made from actual photos ( of the face , at least ) . i can not find correct sources for this , only a few posts on some forums , because the original gamestop page is not valid anymore .
it is currently unknown what tipping does , and taking photos gives you items , but does not affect the shiny rate . the only known ways to increase the shiny chance are : breeding with a pokemon from a different region . ( the masuda method ) chaining via the pokeradar . chain fishing obtaining the " shiny charm " , which is a key item obtained by catching one of every non-event pokemon . sources : http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/photo#pok.c3.a9mon_x_and_y ( photos ) http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/shiny_pok%c3%a9mon#generation_vi ( shiny methods )
ah , i just got it . hide from its view ( behind pillars ) until it stands up on its back wheels . lock onto it and fire at its exposed underside , which will turn it on its back . while it is on its back , smack it around until it turns back over . repeat until the tank is destroyed after the tank is destroyed , you will have to fight the brain itself ( all good boss battles have multiple stages , right ) ? the brain will shoot out a line of light that will damage raz when he walks into it . after spinning twice , the lazer will slow down jump over the slowed lazer while in above the brain , do a ground pound onto it repeat until the brain is destroyed
my approach , in light of the plethora of information contained in the spec of any graphics card , is to go by benchmarks . specifically , tom 's hardware 's benchmarks . of course , benchmarks should always to be taken with a grain of salt , since the benchmark rig might ( and usually does ) overpower your own in many aspects . however , i do believe that this is a good way to get a look at the " raw power " you can expect to get out of any specific card . tom 's hardware also publish periodic recommendations to help you find the best card for your budget . one final note : you should always check which directx technology your card supports ( directx 10 being a requirement on some newer games , though almost any card on the market should support it ) . i apologize for the link bombardment , but this is a really broad subject and there is always research to be done before buying a card .
oceans are large , not to say huge . in theory there is an extremely low chance that your ocean goes on forever , but in reality there will be some kind of continent . it might take you an ingame week of travelling or more , but you will find land when always going in the same direction . oceans are so large because the world defaults to being one huge ocean , and after that other biomes are placed in , forming continents when they touch each other .
a kill assist is awarded to a player dealing a fair amount of damage to an enemy before another team member finishes the enemy off . in the case of the situation you mentioned above , it is probable too much time passed between your damage and the pyro 's . the kill assist mainly applies to situations of multiple teammates engaging an enemy at the same time , so the timer to get an assist is very short .
you have 6 recruits , and unlike previous games , they are unique and can not be changed . when a recruit is " injured " during a fight alongside connor , or takes part of a failed mission , they will become red , and will not be able to come to connor 's aid in fights or go on mission , for a limited amount of time , after which , they will " heal " and return to normal . they can not die , and will forever be with you . also , losing a recruit to injury does not seem to have any implications on the recruit , so you will get them back just as you left them . just wait a while , and you will get them back , all healed up and ready to kick some templar a** .
use your stickerized vacuum thing to suck it up all up . to get the vacuum , go to surfshine harbor , and head to right to find a building with a door pasted on sideways . go into paperize mode , peel it off , and then put it back on upright . next , head through the building and then out the door in the back . walk over to the next door and you will be able to make your way up to the second floor . on this floor you will find the vacuum thing and a hp-up heart .
to answer the question more thoroughly in this game completing quests and raising your shares only changes the stats of the cpus related to that nation . different endings are based upon either doing all the quests/shares , new game + quests , or some special bosses later in the game . all in all do quests and gain shares to make your favorite nations cpus stronger
magic is pretty diverse . need to kill a bandit ? shoot fire from your hands . enemy immune to fire ? shoot lighting or ice . mobbed by a pack of wolves ? charm or frenzy them . archers hitting you hard ? shield or conjure armor and regenerate health . need to escape ? chameleon or invisibility and paralyze . but what if you are facing a breton with dragonskin and some kind of crazy 90% magic resist buff ? well , summon up a skeletal warroir , go chameleon , and heal your summon , while it wails on the poor breton who probably skimped on physical armor to get such awesome magic armor . in short , you do not have to diversify your skills outside of magicka to have a diverse set of combat options .

yup , supposedly the developer put it in so there is a place to add more content .
ingots have limited uses outside of forging . they can be : ground with an elven grinder , to make ingredients for potions , sold to brax , transformed into lutefisk with the hodaric cube . if you chose to transform then , you should rather make something like bolt from them , in order to obtain more lutefisk from one ingot . edit : if you want to sell them , you should before try to craft them into something more valuable , depending on the ingot type : plastic into plastic ring , copper and tin should be made into bronze then a dagger or gladius , if you do not have enough tin , make a cooper ring , with iron , try to make steel then a steel cuirass or even a full plate armor if you have enough , with aluminum , also try to make a cuirass , zinc , brass , silver , gold , electrum and platinum are good sold directly . there may be better deal with cross-metal crafting , but this is what i found for direct metal crafting .
in this particular quest , you can not get both items as reward . you either kill barbas ( poor mutt ) and keep the rueful axe . or hand the axe to clavicus vile and receive his true daedric artifact , viz . the masque of clavicus vile . important thing to note here is that only the masque of clavicus vile counts towards the oblivion walker achievement . i did try to be clever and decided not to kill barbas before he turned to stone . this glitched my game worse than ever . clavicus vile 's statue disappeared . please see this page on uesp for further information .
primal zergs are also referred as " original zergs " . they are zerg that never left their original home planet , zerus , and thus never evolved/mutated source , sc lore ( and the wikis , of course ! ) as for the spoiler : kerrigan 's back to her human form , retaining her boosted psyonic powers and her zerg hairs . she was mercyless in wol but here in hots she moves just by pure revenge . she is dfferent than the old queen of blades : she probably still has a human core on her inner inside , but she is not going to be human again . so , the answer is : 99% corrupted , 1% still sarah . big big big spoiler ( not really , you can find it in the wiki ) : in the final scene , the camera pans around space and galaxy while kerrigan narrates , stating that she must face her true enemy after renouncing everything she has and embraces her role as the leader of the swarm .
those are open bass notes . you strum without holding any fret buttons down . in guitar hero : world tour and onwards a new type of note is present : the open note . the open note is purple in appearance and spreads across the highway . because it does not match up to a target the open note is played without holding any fret buttons . open notes can also be hammered-on . hammer on open notes appear white . the open note can be considered the easiest type of note to hit but can be difficult when played along with regular colored notes . another modified form of the open note exists in guitar hero : warriors of rock . this is the open sustain . the open sustain is played just like a regular open note . since no buttons correspond to it , no buttons must be held to sustain it .
i just found this which answers all questions ! scvs can repair terran buildings or mechanical units ( including other scvs ) under attack which is a key part of defending early game pushes . basically put : scvs can repair any terran structures or any mechanical units . " any " is not in the original quote but i want to put emphasis on the fact it does not narrow down mechanical units to a specific race . of course they can only ever repair allied units . as a side note , zerg does not have any mechanical units and if he neural parasite'd one the unit would still be terran or protoss . source
the two versions are not compatible and can not be played together , especially to a modded version of pc minecraft . as mentioned by @mbraedley , the version that was ported is an older version of minecraft ( though what i have read says it is based off of 1.6 , not 1.8 beta ) . the matching for minecraft-360 uses microsofts xbl systems and such , which pcs do not have access to . and a further incompatibility is that minecraft-360 is limited to a world size of 1000x1000 .
the problem has been discussed on the steam forums . the problem is that each game has to have a binary-identical version of the vc++ redistributables . since games link against different versions of these libraries , steam always installs them the first time as a safeguard . credit to mordi2k for finding the post here 's a link to the steam forum post about it . the text is quoted below . fyi , running this is not a matter of making sure your overall directx install being up-to-date . microsoft has a helper library with d3d called d3dx . you will find binaries for this like d3dx9_43 . dll in your windows\system32 folder . there are over 40 different versions of the d3dx library for d3d9 alone , and many more for d3d10 and 11 as well . each game that uses the d3dx helper library is linked to a specific version . as such the game must run the correct d3d installer version that it was specifically compiled with to ensure the binaries exist . even if a later version of the binary is already installed , that version cannot be used , and even if your directx install is up-to-date because you have run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions . even worse , if a version is installed for x86 it does not guarantee the same version is installed for x64 , so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run . furthermore , microsoft 's licensing terms prevent anyone from distributing the files directly , the only way to distribute them is to run the installer , that is also the only supported method from microsoft to check that the correct version installed . trying to manually check for the correct versions is extremely complicated because there are numerous files that must all be present and individual system configuration options like dll search paths complicate the situation . in addition , the dependencies and required checks may change in each new version of the d3dx runtime . the code to check correctly and repair broken installs all exists in the installer and running it is a guarantee that the correct binaries will exist when you run the game and prevents lots of bad cases where a game would fail to launch with an obscure error if a windows install was either missing the correct version or somehow corrupted in the past . games which do not use the d3dx helpers ( such as source engine games ) do not require running the annoying installer on first launch as they only depend on major d3d9/10/11 versions being installed . however , games that do use d3dx must run it as it is the only way microsoft has allowed for distributing and checking the version info on the files . so that is why we do it for lots of game installs . we can not stop , it is required due to a bad versioning/packaging scheme as well as bad redistribution licensing terms on the d3dx libraries . the one thing that could be made better on our side is that steam could be smart enough to know if an exactly matching version of the dx installer is already downloaded and share that content so you do not download it with each game . since the installer is relatively small compared to most game installs that would not be a huge win though and requires a good deal of new complexity for partners in how they package up their games and manage installation dependencies . you had also still end up with lots of different versions of the installer , since as discussed above they are often targeting different d3dx versions and as such are all required . as such any improvement to avoid duplicates is not an immediate priority , but we may be able to improve it slightly in the future .
you need to create a counter that resets after n ticks , where n is the number of sides on your dice . you can see an overview of creating a counter on wikipedia . all you need to do is add extra logic so that when the output matches n , it resets the counter to 0 . hook up your counter to a fast clock with a switch to stop the clock to simulate rolling the dice . the number rolled will be displayed in binary .

as of the 1.04 patch on 8/21/2012 , each party member gets their own magic find and gold find value applied to the items that drop for them . prior to 1.04 , magic find in a party was averaged between party members . so if you had a 4 person party , one had 40% , one had 20% , and the other two had none , everyone would have an effective magic find of 15% for their own drops . the same thing applies to gold find bonuses and bonuses to xp . for single player with a follower , you get your own value , plus 20% of the bonuses on your follower 's gear . source
no diablo neither others blizzard games have any achievement that are not listed in the achievement list . more achievements can be add in patch and expansion . but the achievements are all there . you may be talking about the internal achievements . as for example the treasure goblin kills . where it ask you to kill 20 treasure goblins , after you accomplished this task , another achievement appears and now ask you to kill 100 treasure goblins . the 100 treasure goblins achievement only appears after you complete the first 20 treasure goblins kills . there are also feats of strength on diablo , you can check the full list here
try putting your server in offline mode . offline\online mode involves your server talking with the mojang servers to find out if your players have an actual account and whatnot . more often than not ' bad login ' is a result of this ' handshaking ' process taking too long . setting your server to offline mode does have its problems however , it allows people with hacked clients to join your server , and it also allows people with some java knowledge to join your server posing as other players . this can lead to some severe griefing . that said , if your only playing with friends that you know then i do not think these issues will come up . i highly advise you do not put your server in offline mode if it is a public server but other than that , it is worth a try .
the truffade adder has a stock speed of "8.6" - which makes it the fastest car in gta5: https://googledrive.com/host/0b-q7wnzcpvltlvvom3ottvlnofe/super.htm however i prefer the overflod entity xf as it has significantly better acceleration and traction - which matters more than top speed imo . both cars will occasionally spawn in the game world ( generally around the richer areas of los santos ) but if you do steal one you cannot " own " it . the adder spawns frequently in front of sessanta nove at portola drive , rockford hills - map : http://goo.gl/erjzix to own one of these cars you need to buy them from legendarymotorsport .net- and they are expensive with the adder at $1,000,000 and the entity xf at $795,000 it is reported that you can own the entity xf via the mission " i fought the law " but this seems like an exploit of sorts : http://gta.wikia.com/i_fought_the_law... if you want a fast affordable vehicle buy/steal a motorbike : https://googledrive.com/host/0b-q7wnzcpvltlvvom3ottvlnofe/motorcycles.htm if you want a fast car you can buy or steal have a look at the schyster fusilade and if you want a fast 4 seater car check out my question about that here : what is the fastest 4 seater car in grand theft auto 5 ?
from the pc gaming wiki 's " tomb raider ( 2013 ) - qte ( quick time event ) steamlining " guide : white circle getting smaller — tap repeatedly melee key ( default f ) . this qte is bugged - circle animation is out of sync with trigger behind qte and therefore it is difficult win this qte normally . luckily there is no penalization for missing said trigger with key press so pressing melee key for whole duration of qte works perfectly .
your third worker will gather at a reduced rate . your fourth worker will not produce additional income . please note that mules can gather over workers , but not over other mules . this results in a limit of 16 workers at full rate , an additional 8 workers at a reduced rate totaling in 24 workers per 8 mineral patches . please note that this is a full page at the bottom of the screem , as each row is 8 units long . it is however advised that if you have less than 16 workers at an expansion that you transfer those of an expansion with more than 16 workers . as for mules , you can have up to 8 mules per 8 mineral patches . the fastest income of a single base you can get is by 24 workers and 8 mules on a gold expansion . for gas , it depends on the distance to the gas geyser . in some cases , full saturation is reached on your third worker , in other cases ( diagonal placement ) the full saturation is reached with a fourth worker . however , the difference between the third and fourth worker is minimal and probably only matters when you are at a high grand master level . and even then , there are probably other more important things to focus on . you do not need a graph for this , when you see a worker waiting outside the gas geyser for long enough you simply have reached saturation . . . here is a graph for gathering minerals with workers : ( click to enlarge ) &mdash ; source : teamliquid wiki - mining minerals
you can not . blizzard does this as a security measure , and the minor inconvenience is worth knowing you are less likely to be hacked . hackers could just steal the cookies off of your computer . i even use an authenticator each time i log in to make sure nobody gets on my account but me .
to answer this question , we need to look into the way mh3u appraises your charms . your charms are pulled off of what is known as a " charm table " , a collection of different charms with different specific stats . this system was present in monster hunter tri as well , though less potentially game-breaking ( for certain values of " game-breaking" ) . unlike in tri , where a charm table was assigned when you started the game , your charm table is assigned to you at character creation . once you create a character , that character can only receive charms from the roughly 20,0000 charms present on their specific charm table . unless , of course , they are assigned a " cursed " charm table . " cursed " charm tables possess only ~800 possible charms , dramatically fewer than the 20,000 in a normal charm table . while this may acceptable , or even preferable , if those charm tables had one or more " god-tier " charms , most cursed charm tables have a horrible selection of charms . one table is even devoid of 3-slot charms . now , how do you avoid getting a cursed charm table ? luckily , most games are absolute rubbish at approximating randomness , relying an easily manipulated psuedo-random number generator . the specifics are not necessary , but what you want to know is this : what charm table you get can be determined by the time at which you created your character . forcing a specfic charm table is acheivable in a few easy steps and only requires a few items . items : your 3ds and mh3u ( obviously ) and a stopwatch ( although this is only strongly recommended unless you have an absolute impeccable sense of time ) turn off any wireless connection for your 3ds . set the date to 21/01/2012 and the stopwatch to the appropriate time interval for your chosen charm table . as soon as you confirm your date/time change , start your stopwatch . open mh3u and hover over " new game " ( do not click ) . as soon as the stopwatch confirms the proper time for you , press " new game " . ? ? ? ( algorithm magic ! ) you now have a character with the appropriate charm table . if you already have a character , you can determine your charm table by following this link and the instructions within . the times for the charm tables are as follows : Cursed Tables: Table 11 00:02:43 Table 12 00:06:41 Table 15 00:08:09 Table 16 00:13:22 Table 17 00:20:03 
you put an item into the scanner and press scan . if nothing happens , the item cannot be scanned ( or it is not coded yet since it is a beta ) . if the item can be scanned , it will be destroyed and be made available for 3d printing which does cost pixels to perform . pixels can be obtained by finding them in containers , by killing enemies , or by refining ores when you can build the refinery . items that are known to work so far are various kind of seeds , like grain or banana seeds .
co-op is a subcategory or game mode of multiplayer . multiplayer covers all games where you are more than one player . co-op is short for cooperative and refers a multiplayer game where you play together with other players to complete a common goal against a non-player enemy . so co-op games are multiplayer games , but multiplayer games do not have to be co-op games . co-op mode is commonly found in shooter games as a way of playing the story mode in multiplayer . examples of this is the multiplayer/co-op mode in quake , saints row : the third and gears of wars series . you also find co-op in many hack and slash , rpg and music games , some examples of these are the diablo series , secret of mana and guitar hero .
the soldier 's will at time of testing is used ( together with a random factor ) to determine whether the soldier will be given psionic powers by the testing . as a result , the same soldier will have a better chance of gaining psionic powers in testing if you first take them on missions and level them up . likewise , a soldier that suffers a critical hit and loses willpower will have a lower chance of gaining psionic powers in testing than they would have had before the injury . raw rookies and squaddies can gain psionic powers , but the chance is much lower , less than one in three , so more often than not , a testing cycles of new recruits will not find a psionic soldier . the " new guy " ( all soldiers start as squaddies ) and " iron will " ( promotions give more willpower ) officer training projects help significantly with gaining more psionic soldiers , " wet work " can also help if you are training soldiers in the field before testing them .
if you are using a stone pickaxe , which is what i almost exclusively use for tunneling , it will not yield any redstone dust - it will simply destroy the block . use an iron or diamond pickaxe ; you will find that not only will it increase the mining speed of redstone ore , you will actually get the redstone dust in return .
starcraft 2 cannot be played on lan .
for console gaming , there is not much of an advantage . some aspects of motion might be made clearer , but it varies between implementations . real 120hz ( usually marketed as 3d-ready/capable/etc ) on pc is a rather different , and has benefits for most games and gamers . also note that 120hz displays do not necessarily transition beween colours any faster than good 60hz monitors , meaning that input lag is often similar .
the absolute upper-limit is 253 total mods . this only counts certain types of mods , though ; specifically , ones that add a . esm or . esp file so they can change actual data in-game ( i.e. . not mods that simply change models or textures ) . this also does include the expansions , and any such mods downloaded through steamworks rather than nexus . the reason for the limit is that skyrim ( and other bethsoft games ) uses an internal code ( the form ids ) for everything added by a mod . the first two hex digits indicate where this thing came from , with 00 being the base game , 01 being official patches to the base game , and ff being reserved for items created by player interaction ( custom potions , items dropped in-world , summoned npc refids , etc ) . this leaves only 253 prefixes for other mods , before the game simply cannot load up items from the mod . note , of course , that any given collection of 253 mods is likely to be impossible to run together anyway for reasons of mod conflicts or of your computer simply being unable to handle them all . 253 is just the absolute theoretical upper limit .
i will try to put them in ways you will relate to : ) souls are unlocked as you do quests and close rifts as you level up . each calling ( class ) has access to 9 souls ( talent trees ) . you can pick any 3 souls at any given time ( when you have earned them all ) and can swap between up to 4 different soul settings ( think dual spec but with 4 slots ) . recommendations are usually not suggested as an answer on these boards . but to give you a little direction , a hunter ( which i also played :d ) is in the rogue calling , and a shaman is more of a cleric calling .
walk up to the birds very slowly , with your net vertical , at ground level . when you get within striking distance , swing the gently from right to left . this technique applies to almost all the creatures you catch with the net . walk up to them slowly , net out and ready .
as far as i know , the guest passes ( 2 for wow , 2 for sc2 ) only come with the boxed version . have you looked under your battle .net" games " tab ? if the digital version did have guest passes , they had have to be associated with your battle .netaccount somewhere .

if you have windows vista or more recent , you can use the inbuilt resource monitor ( admin privs required ) . start the game start searching for games open the resource monitor ( Win , resource monitor , Enter ) you should find the game at the top of the Network tab . click on the checkmark . now , network activity from the game appears in orange on all graphs . join the game ; start playing . as soon as you have a spare moment ( maybe you are in warmup ) , alt-tab to the resource monitor . look at the graphs and at the b/sec readings . they have your answer . it is clunky , but it should work for all games and apps alike . the only " problem " is applications will not show up on the list until they do some networking . if you have more than one process you want to measure ( say , the game and mumble ) , just check them both .
no you will not get corpses , assuming you have the alien containment facility ( based on you mentioning that you have researched them ) you will not get a corpse , you could think of the aliens as being held ' in prison ' by you . once you have researched all captured aliens there is not any need for an arc thrower . if you are only part way through the game you could have 1 soldier carry one , but the slot is best used for something useful .
the key concept at work here is that of card advantage . the basic premise is that cards are extremely valuable , and having access to more of them than your opponent is a strong advantage . perhaps counterintuitively , card advantage is more important than mana advantage ( especially in hearthstone where mana is pretty normalized ) , and card advantage is more important than life advantage ( especially in the early game , when a few life points does not affect anything ) . if you think about it , one minion card can be worth 10 life points if it gets some good attacks in . a spell card can also be worth a lot of life , if it kills another creature which can potentially wreck you . framing your examples using card advantage : elven archer option 1: play on first turn , then get steamrolled by a 2/2 or killed by damage .neteffect : gain 1-2 life advantage , but lose 1 card advantage . option 2: play when it can kill an x/1 , then maybe even attack or block before dying .neteffect : break even on cards ( though note you may have sniped a far better card than your 1-drop ) , as well as maybe gain some life advantage . loot hoarder option 1: burn the coin to play turn 1 , then die to a rogue .neteffect : break even on cards ( due to the deathrattle draw ) , 2 damage to the rogue . option 2: save for later , try to block an x/2 or sneak in an attack .neteffect : potentially up one card ( you lose the hoarder , draw one , but you killed their minion and/or made them burn a card ) and some life . worst case is the same as option 1 . and you keep the coin ! now of course there are exceptions , and there are aggro decks that eschew long-term card advantage in favor of agression . but the theory there is they are setting up a " ticking clock " that the opponent is forced to deal with , probably by making non-ideal decisions as far as his/her card advantage . in general , the main idea is : cards are powerful resources , far more than a few points of mana or damage . treat them as a scarce currency , and spend them wisely to get as much bang for your buck as possible .
as of minecraft 1.3 , singleplayer and multiplayer have been merged , so you can switch your gamemode with the /gamemode command : /gamemode survival /gamemode creative /gamemode adventure you can abbreviate the modes . for example , typing /gamemode c for creative works as well . you can only do this if you have not disabled cheats during world generation , though . if you turned cheats off and still want to do it for whatever reason : the game mode is stored in the level.dat file , which can be edited using an nbt editor , such as nbtexplorer . the game mode is stored in Data/GameType .
you must press the " activate " button while the shout is selected in the menu ( its " r " on pc ) . your available dragon souls are displayed at the bottom right . you must ofc first learn a new word of a shout before you can apply the soul . ( these are found in the stone walls in the whole world )

actually , no . there is no built in-option to hide your hours played . the only way to achieve this is to set your profile on private , but then no one will be able to access the profile . if you do not want anybody to know that you played over 1000 hours barbie and friends , create an extra steam-account and buy the game there . ; )
unfortunately the app and all the online material are only available in english , but you can play the game anywhere in the world where there are portals . i play in berlin , germany and we have more than a thousand portals and more than 600 players here . so if you are able to understand the english app and online material , you can play it in any country . in berlin we also have a very active google+ community in which we speak german . so even if you are not fluent in english , you should be able to play the game , if you know the few terms you find in the game .
poses are safe in hs . they cannot be attacked without an active war , or the attacker will get concorded . it is not completely safe , but if you see a notification for a war pop up , run over and put more hardeners/ecm on it . do not bother trying to have the pos attack back - you want to make it as annoying and difficult as possible for attackers to damage your pos . also remember to load it to the gills with strontium , so that the reinforce timer will kick in . the only things you can not put on a pos in hisec are reactors and moon miners , iirc . ( and of course silly things like jump bridges and capital things ) . the maximum level of security you can put a pos into is 0.7 , no matter how high your corp 's faction standing is . the difference between 0.7 , 0.6 and 0.5 is minimal - the biggest thing is the response time of concord , something a pos is not terribly concerned with .
the term/genre is known as an endless runner or endless flyer . endless games are defined by just that . . . they keep going indefinitely until you inevitably lose , either by ramping up difficulty the longer you go like jetpack joyride or just being difficult from the start like flappy bird and swing copters .
the best way to get statistics on your games is a program called sc2gears . it analyzes your replays and gives lots of data . to get this info , do a multi-replay-analysis on all of your replays , double-click your player name to do analysis on just you , and look at " match-up records " . that screen is a bit confusing though . it shows all the possible ways to express your match-ups . your race is the first one ( e . g . PvZ means you played protoss , ZvP means you played zerg ) . * means any , so *vP means your total stats against protoss and Pv* means your total stats playing as protoss . there is no consideration for " random " . sounds like then you would be interested in the Pv* , Zv* , and Tv* rows . [ update ] sc2gears now supports a google-hosted database of all of your replays . this is basically the direct response to battle .netnot showing win/loss data anymore .
no , i have just looked through all the rct 3 scenarios , and there is not anything there . i am also 99.9% positive ( having played rct1 and 2 for many years ! ) that there is not anything in those as default campaigns .
there should be a " view player manual " button as you right click the game , in your steam library . and also a link to it in the game info tab , when you left click the game . note : as i do not have the game myself ( yet ) . i can not give you a print screen of the game itself , but it should be in the same place .
it is a bug as stated here : http://www.reddit.com/r/steam/comments/1q2cmh/suddenly_50_apps_in_my_library_all_named/cd8i0jg image for when the link is outdated : i have read people are getting this while entering a game key . for some people restarting steam is fixing it . also a quote from the steam forums : mine got fixed sometime in the past day . i got a message from steam support about the ticket i filed and they gave me some steps to fix it if their fix did not take . i will post them here so if someone is poking around online they will be able to find them : if the listings still apear , you may need to complete the steps below to refresh your configuration files for steam : exit steam . please open internet explorer , safari or firefox and type steam://flushconfig then press enter . ( if asked to allow this website to open a program , please click ' allow ' or ' ok' ) when prompted by steam to reset your configuration , please click ' ok ' to confirm . once done , login to steam and re-test the issue . if you have multiple installation folders for games doing this process will remove them . you will need to add the folders again in steam so that your games will appear as installed . in order to add the folders please do the following : open steam click steam > settings ( preferences on mac ) navigate to the ' downloads ' tab click the ' steam library folders ' button click on ' add library folder ' and add the directory that contains your games click ' ok ' restart steam so there you go . happy gaming . source : http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/666825524823897362/#p14 i dont think it is clear what the bug really is . the 1252 etc behind it are probably the appid 's
i have made a pure mage ( high elf ) with just using destruction for damage , but here are a few pointers : yes , join the college asap . by the way you can get a carriage from the whiterun stables to winterhold for some gold ( 50 ) , so thats as good as fast travel . you can get a nice spell like summon flame atronach for only 30 gold while joining the college . ( i do not want to spoil it too much for you ) get the impact perk from destruction if thats your only source of damage ( it is for me ) my mage build and a small discussion about is at this link ( there might be small spoilers ) , hope this helps
yes , there are three alchemy trainers : journeyman : lami located in thaumaturgist 's hut in morthal expert trainer : arcadia located in arcadia 's cauldron in whiterun . ( you killed this one ) master trainer : babette , a member of the dark brotherhood can be found in the dark brotherhood sanctuary ( or in dawnstar sanctuary after completing the hail sithis quest ) and as a bonus , can not be killed .

make yourself appear offline in steam simply use the drop down next to your name in the friends list and select ' offline ' - this will make you appear offline to everybody on your friends list and prevent the sending of the notifications when you log in/out or start playing a game ; setting offline mode will prevent you from chatting with any of your friends , and them from chatting with you also . your friends list will change to show a ' sign in ' button and detail that you are currently ' offline' ; make yourself appear offline by default it is possible to prevent the steam client from logging into friends in the steam settings by clicking on the steam menu in the main client window , followed by settings and then unchecking ' automatically sign into friends when i start steam ' on the ' friends ' tab ; more information it is worth noting that this is not the same as putting your steam client into ' offline mode ' , and still requires an active connection to the internet for steam to work properly . you are also still able to update and download new games - the chat functionality , friends list and game notifications are the only aspects of the steam client affected by setting your status to ' offline ' .
ping is the number of milliseconds it takes for another machine ( usually the server ) to receive a response from yours on a network packet . a lower ping means that your machine responds faster to the server , and hence your position and status is updated more often . a high ping means that your connection is slow , and you are updated less often , which often leads to problems like lag or players warping past you , etc . from wikipedia : in multiplayer online video games , ping refers to the network latency between a player 's computer ( client ) , and either the game server or another client ( i.e. . peer ) . this could be reported quantitatively as an average time in milliseconds , or qualitatively as low ping or high ping . the latter usage is common among players of first-person shooter and real-time strategy games . having a low ping is always desirable because lower latency provides smoother gameplay by allowing faster updates of game data .
build a refinery first , then add a bunker next to each of the existing ones by the bridges . build a billion scv 's , a billion supply depots , and 4 barracks ( one with tech and 3 with reactors ) . tech barrack should only produce medics other three should only produce marines . do not worry about stranded rebels , keep all troops near bunkers until about 9 minutes are left . attack the zerg base at the top left of the map with a force of about 30 marines . concentrate fire on zerg troops until there are none then have half the marines fire at each hatchery . the moment you have destroyed both hatcheries , immediately pull your troops out into the corner away from the zerg base , do not destroy anything further . keep building troops and after a few minutes send a second force of roughly 20 or so troops to meet up with the first force . the hatcheries should have respawned by now and you can go in and destroy them both with little resistence a second time to earn the achievement .
madness ends after phase 29 . if you complete it , you get a victory screen and a new outfit .
if he offers flooz , i take it every time . the only downside to accepting every deal he makes is if you are working to complete a quest and have harvested just enough resources and spent hours/days crafting an item for your villagers , it is painful to have to start that over for a few coins .
knowing when to gank comes largely from experience and practice , but ive found the following to be very useful in knowing when is a good time to gank . are the side lanes pushed up/overextended ? if your team is pushing , you will have a really hard time ganking unless you want to dive them , which is a lot riskier . is the enemy laner there ? if you just killed , or forced your lane opponent to back , if you push the wave in , then you have a good opportunity to gank . i do not advise ganking if the lane is pushed towards your tower though . are there wards ? do you know if the other team has placed wards recently ? try to keep track of where all the wards are so you can avoid them when going to gank . walking over a ward makes you walking all the way to the other lane a waste of time where are your wards ? one spot i love to put a ward is in the brush between the enemy red and river . you can often catch a jungler off-guard or low and effectively ' gank ' him in his own jungle as he goes around clearing his camps . as well , you can use wards to avoid getting counter-ganked , which also sucks . practice ! if you are not sure about when to gank , the best way to learn is to go and do it more ! people learn really well from experience , so if you fail miserably your first few ganks , dont be discouraged . get back to lane , farm up , and try again the next time you 1v1 the other mid laner . do you have flash ? ( thanks to dphil 's comment ) having flash allows you to take a riskier/stealthier/shorter gank path to avoid wards and such . if you get caught out you can quickly escape over a wall if you are not playing someone with some sort of dash . it also lets you secure kills more easilly during the gank .
edit : i dusted off my old copies of pokémon diamond , platinum , and soulsilver to test this . when you enter a trade in the union room , every rotom in your party turns into a normal-forme rotom , even if it is not being traded to another game . the appliances get returned to the room in each respective game . i suppose gamefreak anticipated this issue and implemented this to make sure people would not run into any same rotom-forme problems . it is not possible to have two rotom of the same forme . when you choose an appliance to turn rotom into a specific forme , the appliance then disappears ( until choosing a different forme ) , so there would not be a way to have two of the same forme in your game without cheating .
i have already succeed when i was young to let him live by feeding him only fast fish . i far as i can remember , no . there is no benefit for the hard work that you made . . . only self accomplishment .
whilst the mission is active , you will find the grog nozzle in your inventory . shoot the dwarves with it and lead them into the crusher and splat . they each leave a beard which you can then pick up
the name is a play on the name of political writer " noam chomsky " . i am not entirely sure if valve picked him for a reason other than that his first name sounded like " gnome " .
you will start finding them once you being exploring nightmare difficulty where they are uncommon but not particularly difficult to obtain . the tome of blacksmithing and tome of secrets become available in hell and inferno respectively . source a few reports of seeing pages in normal difficulty seem to be leftovers from the beta period or unsubstantiated .
you need to pull back for 1 second to get a full length arrow off . if you pull back for more than 5 seconds , your hand starts to wobble and you will lose accuracy ( i am guessing this is what you are experiencing when you say that sometimes it does not go in a straight line ) so in order to get a good shot off , you need to charge it for 1 second ( which is what the charging bar shown is ) and fire the arrow before it starts wobbling ( which occurs 5 seconds after being fully charged ) if you find yourself with a charged shot longer than 5 seconds for whatever reason , you can switch out your weapon to reset it , or better yet , press right click again to ' unload ' the shot ( does not waste ammo ) no matter how you shoot it , the arrow is always affected by gravity , but even more so if you do not fully charge the shot ( from memory the shot does less damage for shorter charge as well ) so make sure you always charge for at least 1 second
it sounds like you have the right idea , but here 's some tips or suggestions . buff potions definitely help , and also you will want to make sure you are using the greater health potions , not the lesser ones of course . if you have not done so already , i suggest you try making a very long bridge . it does not have to be completely flat but at least enough that it is very easily traverse-able and you will not get stuck somewhere by accident or fall into lava . you will want to focus more on the battle than trying to get around down there . my weapon of choice for this battle would be one of the flails ( or any big sword such as night 's edge ) for the numerous mini enemies attached to the wall . flails take them out easily and quite efficiently since you can hit almost all of them at once . once those are all done for , this is when switching to the minishark is a good idea . it puts out lots of damage very quickly , obviously , plus the bonus ability to save ammo every-time you shoot it . if you have the goblin tinkerer i suggest you put some money in reforging weapons for better stats , not necessary but makes a very noticeable impact when you get a good one . as for your accessories , you might want rocket/specter boots to get around easier ; a cobalt/obsidian shield so you are not knocked around or into lava , and also in case there any exposed hellstone you could accidentally walk onto ; and a band of regeneration to quickly recover lost hp . the other two are up to your preference really . i would also suggest reforging these to try and get the warding prefix ( +4 defense ) . again not necessary but it will help tremendously in the long run . especially since having 5 warding accessories means +20 defense . you can also try to focus on magic items to defeat it . a vilethorn also makes quick work of the smaller enemies while a space gun ( with full meteor armor ) will constantly damage the actual wall without ever using mana . a demon scythe is definitely my favorite weapon to use against it though . it will hit everything it passes through , and while it is " charging up " , the boss can be directly over it getting hit 3-5 times guaranteed . the only problem is how hard is can sometimes be to find . if you do decide to use magic items make sure you have a full 200 max mana and some mana potions as well . restoration potions can also help here as they give back both mana and hp but will give the " potion sickness " debuff on use , unlike regular mana potions . you can also get a mana flower to equip . this will automatically use mana potions for you so that you will not have to worry about how much mana you currently have . once you do manage to defeat it the first time , beating it again will just get easier since you will have access to higher tier items .
i beat him by filling his mouth full of lightning then putting up a shield that he would hit as he attacked . and when he does the jumping around put proximity based spells on the ground . also , i spam healed myself and kept my shield up . there probably is a better way but , it worked .
sadly there is not really a universal way to transfer games purchased elsewhere to steam . some games will provide steam keys when purchased elsewhere , but for the most part you are out of luck . what you can do is to add a shortcut to the game to your steam library . this steam article describes how to add a non-steam game to your library . this will let your friends know what game you are playing , but you will not have steam integration .
as far as i know , the trial ( free ) version of fraps is able to do screen capture pretty well . i know i used it for a project a couple of years ago - i think that functionality is still free .
thanks to @sevensideddie , i discovered that the error only occurrs when running it with jre7 . this was tested by uninstalling jre7 and instead using jre6 . however , as a java developer , it was really inconvenient to have the the latest java runtime uninstalled as i need it to debug with . i reinstalled jre7 and after some tinkering , i did the following to force it to run with jre6: forcing minecraft to run with jre6 make sure you have both jre6 and jre7 installed . move Minecraft.exe somewhere out of the way , otherwise it will run with the jre7 ( hence causing the problem ) . i use the "%appdata% . minecraft " folder . make a shortcut to Minecraft.exe in your start menu - you can do this by dragging with your right-mouse button into the All Programs section of the start menu . get rid of the "-shortcut " bit if you wish by right clicking on it and clicking Rename . right click on your shortcut and click Properties . under " target:" enter ( with the quotes ) "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%AppData%\.minecraft\Minecraft.exe" make sure that " start in:" is set to %AppData%\.minecraft click Apply and/or OK . now , whenever you want to run minecraft , start it from the start menu . this also works if you pin the start menu icon to the taskbar .
currently there is no way to do this as biome data is not stored in the chunks . in minecraft snapshot 12w07a ( i think it was this one ) , jeb added a new world format which saves the biome data with the chunks . because this snapshot is so new and the minecraft coder 's pack is not released for the snapshots , there probably will not be a mod to allow this until minecraft 1.2 is released . i will update this answer if a tool to do this is ever released .

no one in the game refuses to speak to you based on what you are wearing . they will even talk to you if you are freezing your rear off , stark-naked , in front of them . ( though as communist duck points out , they do remark on it . ) edit i have found that the captain of the guards in solitude gets offended if you walk around in stormcloak armor . instead of making generic " captain of the guard " comments , if you are wearing the stormcloak armor , he will accuse you of being a stormcloak supporter . if you say to his face , in the imperial army 's headquarters , that you hate the empire , he will get understandably angry and attack you ( though he accepts yields , so clearly he does not want to kill you that much . . . ) . so in short , your outfit might add additional dialog options , but as far as i have been able to determine , it never precludes you from any . this is different from new vegas , where it did work like that , but remember , that game was not made by bethesda .
there is no experience for kills in skyrim , only for using your various abilities . for instance , if you hit an enemy with a fireball , your destruction skill will increase slightly . shadowmere and other followers can reduce the amount of experience you get because you may be using your abilities less . but no , the killing blow is not any more special than any other blow when it comes to awarding ' experience' ; each blow awards experience individually .
no , you cannot connect the xbox one controller to the 360 receivers . they are different controllers with different tech and mechanical workings inside , so they share 0 compatibility . you can , however , just plug the xb1 controller in using any old micro usb cable ( they are common household items nowadays ) and it will work .
dragon souls can be saved , so do not worry that the effort in killing the dragon is lost . please note that you need to discover additional shouts if you have learned/activated all your current words , this way you can use your saved dragon souls on the new words of the new shouts . shouts are discovered on the walls of old ruins , and gained by slaying and absorbing the souls of dragons . as more are slain the users ability to learn and use new shouts increases . &mdash ; wikia - elder scrolls v : skyrim - dragon shouts in order to learn new shouts , you need to find all these word walls ; you can get a quest to the next : although finding word walls can be very challenging try and use shouts in major cities . whenever you do this you should receive a note from a courier which tells you " a note for your hands only " this note starts a quest to find a source of power and the current location of the next word wall . &mdash ; wikia - elder scrolls v : skyrim - word wall ( contains more details on all the locations ) to actually learn a new shout , once you have discovered the word wall and have a dragon soul to use , you need to manually activate it in the shouts menu . select the shout and press the activate button . it should be shown on your screen , but i believe the buttons are : r on pc x on xbox □ on ps3
my answer maybe a little off pudding to playing random . . . . . . but the big benefit in trying other races for me is to find their weaknesses and strengths . know your enemy . if i am having a hard time beating an aggressive terran player while playing zerg , i might opt to play as an aggressive terran for so many games . i will get to see how other zerg players face an aggressive terran . i will experience terran 's weak strategy points . i will know their exact timings .
the minimum is 4 characters as shown in the screen shots below . this was changed from 3 to 4 but not sure when as mojang do not publish changes to account details in changelogs . you will still see the old 3 digit usernames and the odd 2 digit ones . they are legit probably old accounts or developer exceptions .
passenger or freight service from surface to orbit . but i sincerely doubt you will ever be that destitute . you will find that a great many of the ships that can be bought really are not that useful for a single lone pilot ; they are available for purchase mainly because all ships are . and , of course , as ever with elite 1 or 2 your fun is where you find it .
i do not know of a way to do this . however , i have an alternate control scheme which you might find worth trying . i do not find single-stepping a scroll wheel a reliable input method , so i have rebound my wheel to function simply as switching buttons : bind "MWHEELUP" "slot3" bind "MWHEELDOWN" "slot1" bind "MOUSE4" "slot2" bind "MOUSE5" "slot4"  i have also bound q to be an ' absolute ' switch key rather than the default last-weapon function : bind "q" "slot10; slot3"  the slot10 causes it to continue to function as the cancel key for spy/engineer menus . if you do not have a fourth mouse button ( as i do ) and do not want to use wheel-press as a switch key ( as i do not ) , then you could bind q to the slot that wheel up/down are not bound to .
i have seen the goatmen grow larger when beating on the drum . not just the drummer , but all kazra within a certain distance grow larger . shortly after the drumming stops ( either they hit whatever limit they are looking for , or you destroy the drum ) , the goatmen will shrink back down to normal size . the only ability i know of that makes monsters grow is avenger , where champions grow larger and hit harder when you kill their friends . i suspect the goatmen 's larger size is to convey the same information ; they hit harder .
you should generally try to learn a variety of builds . while what you are doing is smart , it is also pretty easy to counter if scouted and as you go higher in the ranks you will run into better scouting . you do not want to rely on one build for all of your wins because then when you stop doing that build you will be completely outclassed . marines will beat your marauders cost for cost easily , and any units produced defensively will give the defender an economic advantage . just sitting with zealots and stalkers/marines at the top of a choke point puts your army in a tough spot . your build is great against double protoss , though . protoss earlygame generally relies heavily on forcefield in 1v1 games , but the ramps are bigger in 2v2 maps so it does not work quite as well . if you can micro your marauders well they completely crush zealots , and after you bust the wall the zergling flood is too much for stalkers . a build like this could work as a timing attack even in diamond/masters against opponents trying to fast expand , but that is not a very common option in team games . i would suggest working on a more economic build , such as a 2 barracks fe . your partner can go for a speedling expand or hatch first . learning to play more macro-economic games will be harder at first as you struggle to defend all-ins , but it is a far stronger way to play .
that particular fist weapon is poor quality , so do not let the low attack speed throw you off . later in the game , magic daggers typically have a base attack speed of 1.50 attacks per second . fist weapons are a close second at 1.40 attacks per second . if you want to focus on attack speed , by all means try to get these weapon types . but do not limit your options just for that reason . you may find a 1h spear than is a lot slower but the other stats are so good that its worth using . it is all about your playstyle and what feels good to you . also note that later in the game you can find weapons with the + x% attack speed affix . i have seen plenty of swords and spears with 1.5 and higher attack speed because of this , and i am only level 45 so it will surely go higher .
if she has died , then there is unfortunately no way to get her back . however , she may just have gotten lost . if that is the case , she should return to either the castle in whiterun or one of your purchased houses after several game days .
in 1.7 the shears got introduced . they will not only let you shear sheep , but also cut off leaves which you will be able to pick up and place again .
it does not stack . every time you shout simply resets the duration timer .
since the lost shores update , you can find green , blue , and yellow back slot items as regular drops , and not just from your personal story quest . in addition , exotic and ascended backpieces are available to those who spend their time delving into the fractals and dropping bundles of goods into the mystic forge . the exotic pieces can be bought with fractal relics alone , but to reach ascended , you will need a lot of stuff ! this page has more info .
you can just buy a normal xbox 360 controller . the only difference between both of them is that one comes with the dongle . there is no " windows " and " xbox " controller they work for both .
there are a few quests that'll give you bags : http://nw-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?154301-you-get-bags-from-quests! but they are neither particularly large nor particularly abundant . apart from that , the only way to get bags is through the zen store . also , take note the bag of holes that you can purchase is a ' gag ' item and does not allow you to store even a single item in it .
according to the guild wars 2 wiki , conditions either stack in intensity ( bleeding , etc ) or in duration ( burning , etc ) . bleeding and vulnerability both stack to 25 .
when you buy a house , you can sleep there and store your stuff without fear that it will disappear . a basic house contains a bed and a chest for your things . you can buy improvements such as a cooking pot , alchemy table , tanning rack , additional storage , etc . the improvements available to you vary by the town you buy the house in . they are described in detail here along with the prices for each house and its upgrades . other than that , you also get an achievement ( citizen ) for buying a house .
the level cap has been raised to 61 provided that you purchase the ultimate vault hunter 's upgrade pack . the level cap will not increase until and unless you do this .
if you are on the pc , you can pick one then add the other to your inventory via a console command : rueful axe : player . additem 1c4e6 1 masque : player . additem d2846 1 if you are on the console , you can still obtain both : the wiki shows a rather involved exploit you can do to keep both involving the slow time shout and a weapon rack which requires you to use the shout then travel to your weapon rack and placing the rueful axe on it while clavicus is having a dialog with barbas .
according to answers on a monk mantra question , the following should also be true of shouts : different shouts do stack ( you get the effects of all distinct shouts ) multiples of the same shout do not stack differently-runed versions of the same shout will not stack , but you will get the effect of both runes .
bosses do respawn , so yes . the quickest way to make this happen is to save your game , quit to menu and continue from where you left off . certain maps , such as the vault and terramorphous ' lair even spawn you right inside the map where you left off ; this might also be the case for end of the line . i have been visiting end of the line on playthrough 1 after beating the story mission related to it and wilhelm was there waiting to kill me - he definitively does respawn .
i went to their website , and they had a link that talked about bugs that can not make the player end the turn , they told me to go into , my documents library then find the my games folder and find sid meier 's civilization 5 folder and locate config . ini in the folder and change : EnableGameCoreThreading = 1  to EnableGameCoreThreading = 0  afterwards , i went back into the game and started up a new game and went it finally loaded it still would not work . i do not know if i did it right or not . i tried uninstalling all my mods i have downloaded off the steam workshop , and even the game itself , and still no dice .
it does not matter , and very little is changed . if you go with ralof , the stormcloak , you will be able to stay with gurder in riverwood . if you go with hadvir , the imperial , you will be able to stay with alvor , the blacksmith , in riverwood .
the best way to illustrate this would be to use an example . say you have a station with two platforms , and two sets of signals a and b . if you use normal block signal here , and both platforms are occupied , the signal at a will be green , allowing the next train that comes along to move into the track between a and b . this is bad because if the train from the other platform were to finish and move off first , the train will still be stuck behind the other train , unable to move . this is clearly inefficient , which is where pre-signals come in . by placing an entry pre-signal at point a , and exit pre-signals at the two tracks at b , you can tell the trains to enter a only if the track after any one of the exit pre-signals at b is clear , thus resolving the situation mentioned earlier . a combo pre-signal is basically a combination of the two . it is useful if you have a large station with many more branches , like the one shown in the wiki : in this case , the next train will move up to the topmost platform , and the first entry pre-signal will turn red , preventing any more trains from entering the tracks between the exit and entry pre-signals until at least one of the four have moved off .
as you can see from here , skyrim can generate loot that is level-dependent ( and random ? ) , even in the open . level-dependent items include : . . . some items sitting out in the open . unlike previous elder scrolls games , in skyrim developers can place dummy objects , for example on tables or shelves . these dummy objects are then replaced by a leveled item when the dungeon contents are spawned . this is most frequently done with potions , but is also done for armor , arrows , books , soul gems , and weapons .
it does not interrupt . you can go do other things and come back to check if it has finished .
you can only have one follower at a time : if you want a different one , you need to dismiss the first one before you recruit them . there is one exception to this : there are situations when you already have a follower when a person needs to join you for something quest-related . in this case , the quest-related follower might join you in addition to your current follower . however , there are situations where he or she will just replace your current one instead . at any rate , this is temporary , and the second follower will leave when the quest is complete . followers can be found all over the world : it'll be hard to avoid finding followers . there are 45 in total : 6 mercenaries : generally one per hold city 5 housecarls : one per thane appointment in the cities where you can buy a house 7 members of the companions 3 members of the college of winterhold 2 members of the dark brotherhood 9 quest-related or dungeon-related followers 13 followers you can recruit if you have done them a favor in addition to a single follower , you can buy a wardog in markarth side for 500 gold , which acts as another member of your team . there are two dogs you can choose from : vigilance and meeko . you can also pick up a stray dog after a random encounter . finally , while they are not followers , the conjuration school naturally gives you access to spells that summon the forces of oblivion fight for you for a period of time ( or permanently , at the higher levels ) .
how acquiring technologies works first of all , it is important to understand that you do not get technologies by the number of turns you invest , but by the number of science points you have , just like it works for culture policies . it is just hard to see when looking at the technology graph because it only lists the amount of turns it will take ; but each technology does , in fact , have a cost in science points . you can see that cost by opening the technology 's civilopedia page ( this can be quickly done by right-clicking the technology in the graph ) . this is the reason , by the way , that you sometimes get technologies earlier or later than what is listed in the graph - because the estimation is done based on your current amount of science per turn , and that can change . also , be aware science points overflow - if you completed a technology , all left-over points will be immediately put to use on your next technology being researched . this applies regardless of the source of science points , so it will also work with a science boost ( see below ) . how the science boost works so , a science boost is given in science points , not in number of turns . if i understand correctly , a science boost works this way : make a list of all the technologies you can currently research ( that you have all the prerequisites for ) . find the cost for each of these technologies . find the median value of the above costs . multiply it by 0.5 . this value gets boosted by 0.25 if you started rationalism , 0.25 if you have the porcelain tower and 0.5 if you both started rationalism and have the porcelain tower . this number is the number of science points you get . for example , say you can currently research steam power , biology and fertilizer . steam power and biology cost 2350 science , while fertilizer costs 1600 science . the median of the set {1600 , 2350 , 2350} is 2350 . let 's also assume you have the porcelain tower . the number of science points you will get is 2350 * 0.75 = 1762.5 . by the way , on a personal note , this is a much better system than the previous one , in which you just got the cheapest technology available for free . . . although admittedly this is also much more tedious to calculate . as a rule of thumb , this will usually advance you by " half a circle " in your current research . how to maximize the effects of a science boost as for maximizing the effects , there are 3 basic ways to make it better : build the porcelain tower , which is a great wonder even without this boost , on account of the free great scientist . start rationalism . that is a great policy anyway for getting more science . make more research agreements ! remember you can make a lot of research agreements simultaneously , as long as they are not with the same civ . also remember that the ai civs love their research agreements , so if they will not make them with you they will make them with the other civs - meaning two other civilizations get stronger and you get nothing . it is better for you to be one of the two .
no , you do not have to select a perk in order to level it , though it helps tremendously .
your items are not safe - i believe it takes less than 48 in-game hours until the items disappear . the good part is they allow you to start off with a good amount of space in your inventory to hold everything . hope that answers your question .
even before 1.2 , this was fixed so that blocks no longer take the space of water . they simply ' hold ' the water . this means you can no longer eliminate pools of water by burying them , which means more work for hellivator diggers . what you can do is create a side-shaft to drain the water into . if you are dealing with a large pool , you may want to build walls on either side to block out most of the water . then , just build a shaft long enough to contain the rest of the water and let it flow in . wall it up and keep digging your downward shaft . if it is a relatively shallow pool though , just dig a trench near the bottom to drain it away from your shaft , then continue construction . do not forget about this water though , as it will be very useful later for getting through lava . pouring your pools of water over it will form obsidian , which you can then mine out to continue your shaft downward . you may even want to have it follow you down to the bottom , digging out occasional air pockets so that your giant pool of water will be available immediately when you reach lava levels .
yes , you can level up non-selected perks , provided you are using a proper weapon ( or healing others ) . on low difficulties i commonly pick up a bullpup no matter what perk i am currently using , to avoid " wasting " stalker kills .
from uesp : swords maces war axes daggers* the material type will not affect whether or not its one or two handed . ( note that daggers do not benefit from one-handed skill perks armsman or bladesman . but instead they benefit from the perks in the sneak tree , namely backstab and assassin 's blade . source ) finally , here are the two handed weapon types so you know which ones to avoid : greatswords warhammers battleaxes there are also bows , which benefit from neither one handed perks and levels nor two handed perks and levels .
this is indeed something you figure out during the course of the game ( unless you are in the habit of completely ignoring computers and the e-mails they contain ) . if indeed you are impatient , take a look : the phenomenon you are experiencing is something that tai-yung medical ( and someone else , who i shall not name to avoid an additional unnecessary spoiler ) is behind , in order to prompt people to replace their " faulty " neural interface augmentations with a new " improved " augmentation that does not suffer from this fake problem . the new augmentation chip acts as sort of a kill-switch that allows shutting off people 's augmentations remotely ( and other things , again , i am trying to avoid unnecessary spoilers ) . as far as i can tell , the game never explains how this fake problem is caused , but i may have simply missed the explanation during my playthrough . you have a chance to replace your own chip with the " improved " version . if you do so , during a later boss fight your augmentations will be disabled .
to answer the question , no , only lutefisk cubes have this reaction when put into another lutefisk cube , anything else will just be skoled into lutefisk .
if i am understanding your question properly , in order to have two heart of the swarm licenses you need two wings of liberty licenses . since heart of the swarm is not a stand alone expansion , you need to have all the prerequisite games in order to play it ( each copy ) . you can see for example , on this cataclysm box art for world of warcraft , that it requires " wrath of the lich king to play " . wotlk says it requires tbc , and tbc requires the base game . it is expansions all the way down . this trend stands true for all blizzard games to date , as they do not release stand alone expansions .
use shears to get wool from sheep .
so , playthroughs first . once you have completed the game once , when you load a character you are given the option of going to playthrough 1 ( the one you just finished ) or playthrough 2 ( a new game , same character ) . as for the dlc , i got it all with the goty edition , and then played it straight through after finishing the base game . you should only need to have finished the game once ( depending , of course , on how many side missions etc you have completed ) .
it means that you have hit the enemy . this is especially important when firing rockets at enemy vehicles , since frequently after you fire you have to hide to avoid dying so you can not see if you got a hit . it does not mean , however , that you have disabled or destroyed a vehicle , so also be alert for the " vehicle disabled " and " vehicle destroyed " notifications coming up on your screen
hold the activate key ( e , ⓧ , or ⓐ by default for pc , ps3 , and xbox , respectively ) . the z key defaults to your dragon shout/racial power on pc . be careful with that .
regular minecraft does not know what mods are , so it will completely ignore your mods folder and never do anything with any files you put in there unless you " teach " it to look there , and what to do with the files it finds . the usual " teaching " method is by installing forge , which is exactly designed to teach minecraft to look for and load stuff you put in the mods folder ( among other things relevant only to mod-makers ) . installing forge is really simple : download it . choose the " recommended " build for your version of minecraft , and click the " installer " link . run the installer . in the minecraft launcher , choose the new profile named " forge " or similar and click play . if you want greater explanation of how the installation process works , you can read the installation article on the forge wiki .
there is not much difference in terms of the rest of the story - regardless , celes will leave the island in search of her friends . if cid lives , he will send celes off on the raft he is built , and if he dies , celes will discover a note that inspires her to take the raft on her own . after you have left the island , i do not believe the game is different in any way . i think if he lives , you can return to the island later to visit him , but i do not believe this changes the events of the game either . there is a description of the events on this page : if cid dies , celes will find a raft that he built so she could sail to freedom , but not before attempting suicide ( which is referenced more in the japanese version of the game ) . if cid lives , he will show celes the raft he was building and give it to her so she can leave the island . regardless of whether cid lives or dies , celes will eventually set out to find all of her friends .
if you tithe enough pieces , you get an artifact you can use or sell . from the wiki : each lutefisk tithed increases the chance of receiving a random reward ( each lutefisk increases the chance of obtaining an artifact by 0.2% , up to 100% ) . you can sell to the shopkeeper three ways : click on the item in your inventory and then drop it onto him . click on the item in your inventory and then drop it onto an available space in the shop . hold down shift while in a shop to enable quick-sell mode . then click on the item in your inventory . it will be sold immediately without telling you how much you will get or confirming the sale , so be careful .
depends on what you want . in the long run , you are going to have a ton of money left . i am about level 36 , yet to complete any major storylines except the thieves guild , and have 78,000 gold ( and 80 iron daggers to enchant for 900 each , and 50 dwarven bows for about 1500 each ) money stops becoming a huge issue and you can simply buy more from vendors . also , the amount of creatures you can actually get grand souls from are very small - i believe it is giants , mammoths , dragons ( maybe ? ) , and maybe some high level daedra . in comparison , you can get the same soul from bandits , sneak killing guards , or killing sprees . in the long run , i would choose the black star - soul gems become so common in the later game in comparison to black ones ( i have found 2 black ones , and 60+ others ) .
you gain 2 vitality for every level up , including paragon levels . so the formula you have listed in the question is essentially correct , except that it is 7 + ( level * 2 ) + ( paragonlevel * 2 ) + gearvitality .
the honest answer would be waiting just as long as it takes for you to be able to afford 100 new mining machines , buy them , wait again etc . until the time required to obtain the ( now ) 5e6 ironbars for the plane . the cheating answer is , open a javascript console and enter ironbars = 5e6
the correct way to beat ffe is not to all-in or go for early aggression ( which can work but is gimmicky and not reliable ) but to expand faster yourself . think about what your opponent can not do when he ffes . . . correct , punish you for greed . take for example games of stephano where he gets his third as early as 4:30 and that way has a far stronger economy that allows him to just overwhelm his opponent with the sheer number of roaches whenever the protoss tries to be aggressive . the usual followup to that is to tech up to hive and break the wall with infestor/broodlord/corruptor . take a look at this day9 episode which - while focussed more on lategame - still shows some early/midgame stuff . http://blip.tv/day9tv/day-9-daily-429-p1-stephano-s-zvp-late-game-style-6009413
ezio must find certain sets of hidden books to unlock the locations of the masyaf keys hidden around istanbul .
shield operators gain experience for every shield bubble filled during combat and combat only . i does not matter if the bubble needed to be filled because of enemy fire , asteroids , or even because the shields were manually powered down and up again .
i do not know how aatrox fits into this , but i assume it is the same as anivia 's egg and the order goes as follows , from first to last : zilean 's ultimate guardian angel anivia 's egg ( i assume aatrox 's passive works the same ) yorick 's ultimate afterlife abilities ( karthus and zyra 's passives ) also found this interesting thread on the subject from the lol forums . tested on august 5th 2013 . there is also another answer that covers this quite well .
there are six different types of signals you can use , and can be used as two-way signals for tracks meant to go both ways , or one-way signals for tracks meant to go in only a single direction . block signals : these separate track parts into " blocks " , which can contain only a single train per block . these blocks can be as large as you want , or as small . for efficiency , you will want them roughly 10 blocks long . less if the average train size is smaller . if a train hits a block signal that already has a train , it will be stopped , and wait for the track to clear before proceeding . if for some reason a train hits the wrong side of a block signal , it will stop and turn around , as it thinks it is going the wrong way down the track . pre-signals need a bit of explanation before telling you how they work . they work like block signals , so they divide the track into blocks , but take their input from signals further down the line . they are really meant for one-way tracks , so i would not recommend using them for two-way tracks . i will explain how they work , and then afterwards how you can use them in combination . entry pre-signals : these signals work in tandem with exit pre-signals . they are meant for one-way tracks that split into two or more paths . you place an entry signal before the split . the closer you place it to the split , the less time the block will be in use . exit pre-signals : place these after the track splits . one on each track . ideally right after , to minimize the amount of time the block remains in use . they function exactly like block signals , and " reserve " the block after the signal for a single train . if the block is open , they display a green light/bar is up . now , the point of the entry and exit pre-signals is for efficient pathfinding . as long as a single exit pre-signal is green , the entry signal is green . every single exit signal has to be red for the entry to be red . this differs from block signals by one critical difference ; trains are kinda stupid . take a look at this picture : this is using block signals . note that both stations are occupied by trains . since the block right before the station ( where the split is ) was free , the block signal before the split let the train in , right before the station . this means it has to wait until the train directly in front of it moves out of the station before it can continue . the top train could leave , and the train waiting for a berth would not budge . it is stuck , and will hold up the entire track until the bottom train moves . but if you use the pre-signals , the train waits before the split . that means as soon as either station track is clear , it can advance , and will not necessarily wait for the bottom track . it'll be first come , first serve . combo pre-signals : these work like both entry and exit pre-signals . they are meant to be used if you have a large number of splits in a short area . you had use an entry before any of the splits happen , exit signals after all the splits are done , and combos in between . this picture shows a good example of when to use combo pre-signals : at one track , there is an entry signal , getting it is signal from the two combo signals right after it , and they , in turn , are getting their signals from each of their two exit signals . by layering it like this , the train is still held up before committing to any track that might cause it to rely on a train to leave the station . note that you can just use entry and exit pre-signals as well ; remove the combo signals , and it will function just the same . for the most part , there is no real reason to use combo signals . path signals are exclusive to openttd ; they were never in transport tycoon deluxe . what they do is allow a train to " reserve " a section of track before it gets to it . if it succeeds in reserving the track , it will use it , even if another train is inside the " block " . this picture does a pretty good job of explaining it : if you were only using block signals , the second train would be held up until the first train clears the junction , even if it is not using the bottom lane . with path signals , the second train will not even slow down ; it succeeded in reserving the bottom lane , so away it goes . there are some more examples for path signals at the wiki you linked to . this is just meant as a general use reference .
yes , with an xbox 360 wireless receiver . available for about $17 from amazon : http://www.amazon.com/xbox-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows-pc/dp/b000hzfct2
change you default recording device in windows to something else another device that is completely different do your microphone , then if you still want to use skype or teamspeak you can assign a different microphone in their settings . i have this as standard just for those kind of games . normally the developer will patch this because they will get a lot of complaints from the community
there are two solutions to this level . the first solution , as mentioned before , is to pay the sorceress the sum of 1 million lollipops . now this does not sound all that appealing . this is the easy way to do it . however , if you want to save yourself the lollipops and time , fight yourself and wait until the moment you drop under 25 life to cast a fire scroll . easy win if you can time it right . i had about 400 life when i killed myself , so health was not an issue . i suppose the fire enchanted sword would be optimal since it does additional damage .
aside from wear and tear on the disc there are performance benefits for some games ( not older ones because they were made before the install technology was made available ) and the benefit of saving the optical reader for your disc drive . most newer games will increase performance because the 360 ( as with most computing products ) reads quicker off a hard drive than a disc and processing it that way ( assuming it is not a slow rpm drive ) . you may want to read through some of the answers here as they highlight other points : should i install xbox 360 games to my hard drive ?
as of patch 2.0 , all items level 1-60 now salvage into common debris ( for white and grey items ) , exquisite essences ( for blue items ) , iridescent tears ( for yellow items ) , or fiery brimstones ( for legendary items ) . any of the old crafting items you had were converted into their equivalent new item . items from level 61-70 turn into reusable parts , arcane dust , veiled crystals , and forgotten souls for white , blue , yellow , and legendary items , respectively .
to zoom in , you can hit the z button there is also an option in your settings under gameplay that will automatically zoom in on your character when you open the inventory screen .
no , you do not lose anything by going up a difficulty level i have played through normal , nightmare , and am in hell now , and have not seen any decrease in my character 's stats when changing difficulty levels . other things , such as life leech , are affected though . see this post for a full list of what is affected by diffculty
if you have access to another computer at a location with a properly working network , then you can : log onto that computer install steam download the game you want ( to that other computer ) , using the steam client . then download the relevant files from the other location to yours using a protocol which works even in very poor connections ( e . g . sftp with resume , scp , http ( move the downloaded file to a webserver ) , . . . ) this will work if the download speed is a problem in combination with the steam client . it will not work ( or work poorly ) if the problem is not the download speed , but some other reason which messes up your network ( e . g . lost packets ) . which is likely given that other programs such as chrome also run into problems . in that case the proper solution would be to fix your network , which starts with identifying what goes wrong . you did not add any os to your question , but start with this : steamos/linux : ifconfig eth0 link encap:ethernet hwaddr 01:27:b0:14:da:fe up broadcast running slave multicast mtu:1500 metric:1 rx packets:2746252626 errors:0 dropped:1151734 overruns:0 frame:0 tx packets:4109502155 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 rx bytes:427998700000 ( 408171.3 mb ) tx bytes:3530782240047 ( 3367216.3 mb ) interrupt:40 memory:d8000000-d8012700 os x : ifconfig ( probably with en0 rather than eth0 ) windows 7: [ start ] [ run ] cmd netstat -s
it depends on what game it is . obviously valve 's own games are possible to register on steam . call of duty : modern warfare 2 also comes to mind since that one has to be played via steam . here is a list of all retail games that can be activated on steam : https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7480-wusf-3601
according to the starcraft wiki , the use of large-scale nuclear weaponry was banned in the late 2490s due to their ( mis ) use in quashing the rebellion of korhal : the colonists of korhal iv rebelled against their former masters , the terran confederacy . the latter resorted to assassinating its first leader with ghosts but still failed to control the rebellion . the confederacy resorted to firing a thousand apocalypse-class nuclear missiles at korhal from the distant confederate capital of tarsonis , killing four million people and destroying most life on the planet and setting the forests on fire . after the korhal incident , full-scale use of nuclear weapons were banned on habitable worlds . the confederacy began using smaller missiles , targeted by ghosts ravendreamer also found this from the sc1 manual : although our typical image of a nuclear weapon is something that obliterates a large area , tactical nuclear devices exist today , and were deployed as far back as the 1960s during the cold war . although nuclear weapons generally produce a much larger and more devastating/deadly explosion than conventional bombs , there are conventional bombs with more explosive force than the smallest nuclear weapons . theoretically , a bomb launched from a silo and laser guided to a ground target could do damage consistent with the starcraft nuke , although i do not believe this has ever happened in a war scenario .
this indeed indicates the ammo type you are using . it seems to be rather bugged at this time , often forgetting the colour after a short while and reverting back to the default .
developer 's say no i am afraid . . . and i guess i can see why .
hard to say , how do you want to play ? frankly there is no best build for every situation , the best you can hope for is to pick things that'll you need for every map , tourism/money/food . things of that nature . ultimately , play how you want , your skill is more important than your avatars .
sorry guys , i obviously did not look hard enough before posting the question : it is a specific bug in the linux port due to a lack of physx support in nvidia drivers . cheers for all the responses .
you can select the default position of the popup by editing the file resource/styles/gameoverlay.styles in the steam directory and searching for the Notifications.PanelPosition variable . possible values are BottomRight , BottomLeft , TopRight and TopLeft . note though that the default position can be overridden by the game . in which case , unless the developers have included an option to configure it , you are at a loss .
i believe that he is completely unstoppable , as far as i can tell he is just a way for the cultists to win the round and the little cut-scene that shows narsie rising is just fluff .
okay . the creature you want to keep an eye out for are the phazon puffers . they drain phazon from you to power their attack , reducing your corruption in the process . however , if they hit you with the attack , you wind up gaining more corruption than they first removed . a valid strategy then becomes to let the phazon puffers charge up , and then kill the creatures or dodge their attacks , reducing your phazon with each cycle . you can also be proactive about this final segment by not traveling to phaaze until you have the maximum amount of energy tanks . while it is not shown in terms of numbers , the more energy tanks you have , the larger your " effective " health , and thus the more corruption you are able to withstand . on phaaze , sometimes enemies drop " anti-phazon " pickups instead of the regular phazon health recovery you have been grabbing throughout the game , and absorbing these will reduce your corruption level . finally , using the overload ( push forward ) ability of the hypergrapple ( where applicable ) will also reduce your corruption . as you gathered yourself , your phazon corruption increases naturally both over time and as you take damage . i could not , however , find any indication that firing your weapons increased or decreased your current phazon level .
the fastest way to get money is le wow . but , it does cost 100k to attempt . i built a strategy to do it . first , you need 2 high level pokemon ( 70 or higher ) , preferably ones who can use moves like earthquake or surf ( i use charizard and flygon ) . make sure they also have a stalling move ( like fly or a stat raiser ) so you can be more precise with the turns completing . secondly , you need an amulet coin ( for increased money earning ) and prize money o-power ( level 3 preferably ) or a friend who can use it . now , have your two high levels in slot 1 and 2 of your party . make sure one has the amulet coin . walk into le wow and use the prize money o-power . then talk to the lady . choose the double battle and pay her 100k ( can be lowered , not sure how ) . now , you go through a series double battles . each double battle gives prize money ( and good exp for leveling pokemon ) . try to win the battles in the target time stated for more end money . once all of the battles are over , you are rewarded balm mushrooms , which go for 6k each . if you get all of the battles in the correct amount of turns ( and none of your pokemon fainting ) , you get 25 balm mushrooms . 25 * 6000 = 150000 poke , which is more than you had to pay to enter . also , you get 10k for the first 2 battles ( without amulet coin ) and 4k for the last 3 battles ( without amulet coin ) . 150000 + ( 20000 * 2 ) + ( 8000 * 3 ) = 24000 + 40000 + 150000 = 214000 poke per run . that did not include the prize money o-power , but it did include the amulet coin . 214000 - 100000 ( fee to enter ) = 114000 poke profited per run , if everything goes right . if you do not have 100k poke to enter le wow , you can do elite four runs ( with amulet coin + prize money o-power and/or the battle chateau to earn 100k easily . also , if you are lucky , the people you beat at the battle chateau might give you selling items , like pearls and nuggets . both the elite four and le wow give lots of profits , but le wow is much easier seeing that your opponents only have 2 pokemon in double battles ( 3 in triple and rotation ) , and are always level 63 . also , unlike the elite four , the people in le wow do not use full restores . edit : with the new event inkay ( with a move called happy hour ) you can make even more money . but , as of now , it is a japanese only event . the move increases the money earned from battles . edit : if you throw in payday , you can get even more money . payday takes the level of the user , multiplies it by 5 ( in gen 3 or higher ) and scatters coins of those value . and , it is effected by amulet coin ( pokebank will allow you to move a meowth/persian up to x and y ) . and then at the end of the battle , you pick the money and it is added to your amount . edit : if you complete the le wow challenge perfectly at least once , the cost for it lowers . edit : if you use amulet coin + prize money o-power 3 , and have the discount , you earn a total of 150000 + ( 60000 * 2 ) + ( 24000 * 3 ) - 90000 = 252000 per run , plus lots of exp .
they will all fire at the same time . however , you can change the location of the weapon by changing the weapon slot it is equipped in . the ones at the front of your ship . . . . . . will have less distance to travel . ( most of the time , it works 4/5 times for me ) . however , weapon speed is also a factor ; when you compare them , ion and flak weapons are around the same speed , and lasers are almost two times that speed . source:http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/weapons/tables
you can deliver a bitizen to any imperial level at any time they are in the elevator . if that imperial level is currently under construction , or it is making an item ( filling an order ) , it will result in the wait time until completion being reduced by 1 minute . as for the bitizen , the normal thing is the bitizen is gone forever ( unless it is a special bitizen such as luke or leia or c3po ) . this is the same fate as what happens to any bitizen " shopper " or residential visitor to your non-imperial levels .
minecraft allows you to do this directly using different versions of the /worldborder command : start with /worldborder center ~0 ~0 to center the future border around you . set the border radius to something small : /worldborder set 30 . make the border grow by a large number of blocks over a large amount of time : /worldborder add 1000000 10000000 will , for example , add 1 million blocks in all directions over 10 million seconds , i.e. 1 block every 10 seconds . repeat steps 2 and 3 ( with different numbers ) until you are satisfied with the speed .
according to this discussion in the steam community : stand next to a wall , the " camera " will move to prevent the screen from being obstructed and subsequently will be too out of position for your character to be in the line of sight . and if your character still does not behave : well , i ran straight up to a wall and opened my inventory and was immediately disappointed to see my character 's image on the screen . then i held mlb and twisted the screen and pop , it disappeared ! another point that may be of interest , following another discussion in the steam community : it might be your resolution , i run at 2560x1440 and he sits at the side nicely like all the other chars .
you can also gain both their support under specific circumstances . wreave must be alive instead of wrex . you had to destroy maelon 's data in me2 . with maelon 's data destroyed eve dies during the run towards the genophage distribution facility , you can then persuade mordin that with eve dead wreave will have no one to control his krogan behavior and he will agree on faking the genophage cure . wreave thinks he is cured , you get krogan support . you did not cure the genophage , you get salarian support . if wrex is alive , the only way is by saving the council dude . either way is pretty heartbreaking , you either lose wrex or you lose thane or kirrahe .
if the controller is under warranty , you should contact sony support for your region . if not , you could try opening up the controller yourself and having a look inside . it might be as simple as dust getting in . you might be able to see an obvious issue , and you can keep the controller plugged in so you can test the button as you investigate . there are many youtube videos which show you how to disassemble ( and reassemble ) your ps3 controller . just search for " disassemble ps3 controller " .
notch on twitter is pretty clear on the topic : i have no plans of adding herobrine . notch
to answer this i am going to need to establish some criteria for " ideal " . i am going to assume that most people are interested in the most efficient use of a given space for high density buildings allowing you to stuff as much population/commerce/jobs into your city as possible . luckily the game itself provides an excellent tool to help you with this . turning on the " gridlines " feature when plopping a road tile will display gridlines for the last two road tiles you mouse over . the gridline displayed for a given road depends on what road you moused over and what road type you currently have selected . mouse over avenue with road selected : the first gridline will provide enough room for two high density buildings back to back making for maximum use of the space given the two road types you want to use . mouse over avenue with avenue selected : same as above mouse over road with avenue selected : same as above mouse over road with road selected : the first gridline will provide just enough space for a single high density building to exist between the roads . the second gridline will provide enough space for two high density buildings back to back and a gap inbetween that could fit a road ( or is potentially useful for narrow parks ) .
homes provide many benefits : organization : there are lots of storage spaces that allow you to sort all the junk you tend to collect over time into manageable groups . scattering all of your junk on the floor makes it harder to pick through later on . for example , i have a chest where i stash all my smithing stuff ( ores , bones , leather , pelts , etc ) . another place where i place all my alchemy ingredients , and another for all my soul gems , etc . convenience : in most homes ( other than whiterun ) , there is an alchemy table next to an enchanting table . some even have cooking areas , tanning stations , etc . this makes it much more efficient when you take into the fact that you have access to nearby storage containers . spouse management : having a home will also allow you to send your spouse ( should you choose to get married ) to live there rather than having to find them or travel to an out of the way location . this is really handy for certain spouses who do not have a home and travels around a lot . vanity : every home have some sort of way for you to display items . from book shelves to weapon racks , weapon plaques , dagger display cases , mannequins , etc . depending on how much of this you care about , being able to walk into a home stocked up on stuff like this gives you a great sense of accomplishment . you can also do silly things like drop all your gems onto a table ( or into a bowl ) and literally watch your treasure pile up . social status : some holds require you to own property before allowing you to become a thane , which grants you a housecarl for a follower as well as the ability to make guards look the other way for crimes .
no one can answer this yet . as there have only been one patch to the system ( available worldwide ) . there is not enough data available to say anything general .
yes . if you use two evolution level 2 cards to evolve into the final evolution 3 tower card , the resulting evolution 3 tower card will be slightly stronger than a tower card that used an evolution 1 + evolution 2 cards to evolve to an evolution 3 tower . i was able to quickly test this with fire towers , comparing a maxed 1 + 2 evolved 3 fire tower , to a maxed 2 + 2 evolution 3 fire tower . the 2 + 2 evolution 3 fire tower is slightly stronger .
well , before i jump directly into answering this , lets investigate the ways you can gain the most money , which in turn allows you to buy the most stuff . contracts its partially depends on your ability to fulfill contracts . if you can successfully complete high reward contracts you will gain more money and more experience at a greater rate then players who cannot . try and make sure you always have an ' active ' contract so your kills are constantly working towards something . gun challenges its also worth noting that more kills trumps completing challenges almost every time . what i mean by this is do not spend your time on a gun you suck with for experience . the opportunity cost of the kills you did not get by using a crappy gun greatly outweighs the experience you gain from the challenges . by using a better gun you will get more kill streaks which in turn gives you more experience and more kill streaks , and kill streaks also give experience ! kill streaks pick low kill streak rewards ( as these provide you with extra experience every time you call them in ) and try and get these often ( hardline ? ) . keep in mind that getting dogs , while awesome ( 11 kill streak ) provides the same amount of experience as calling in a spy plane . by using low achievable kill streaks you will gain more experience by using the kill streak , gain more experience by challenges for the kill streak , and gain more experience by the kills you get when your kill streaks are up ! most of this game is about snowballing your momentum . equipment one of the most often over looked ways of gaining experience . not utilizing your equipment is bottom line a wasted opportunity . do not think of throwing that flash bang grenade as -wasted- think of it as utilized . every time you die with out throwing your flashbang you have wasted the opportunity to potentially save your life , potentially get a kill , and work on your equipment challenges . wasted equipment is sad equipment . utilized equipment is just one more lair of the snowball ( see above ) keeping these things in mind will help you level up faster , but its worth reiterating the most important part of this description . if you are using crappy perks and crappy guns to get challenges you will lose experience . the smarter you play ( low kill streaks , great perks , great gun ) the more kills you will get which will lead to more kill streaks which will lead to more challenges which will lead to more experience ! thesis now this seemed like a long detour to the point , but here it is . if you play better you can afford to buy more points . there is nothing wrong with " this looks neat " when you have a ton of cash laying around from following my above examples . as far as an ' optimum route ' this really depends on how you play . ever had a friend argue with you for hours about how ' their xyz ' is always the best but it just does not work for you ? you and i will be significantly better with different guns and different perks , but you wont find whats ' optimized ' for you until you try it . buy as much as you can and try it out on a ' test ' class while you get a feel for which guns and perk choices fit your play style best . want a pink rabbit emblem on your famas that is strictly asthetic ? go for it . want to try a new gun ? go for it . just make sure you always dedicate a class to something you know you can kick ass with . that will give you a fall back while you investigate which perks and guns are good for you ! hope this helps starting classes that work for me while purely subjective , here are some classes that might help you get started my favorite assult rifle class ( 5 k/d ratio ) large maps galil ( best assult rifle i have unlocked so far could also be famas ) red dot + silencer ( keeps me off the radar ) frag + concussive grenade + claymore hardline or ghost ( depends on amount of spy planes ) warlord ( for the 2 attachments ) ninja ( if you wear a good pair of headphones it will change your life ) my favorite smg class ( 4.2 k/d ) small maps ( nuketown etc ) ak 74u w/ grip or silencer semtex or frag , concussive , and motion sensor lightweight or hardline or ghost ( depending on map size + spy plane ) hardened ( bullet penetration , may have botched the name ) ninja ( as always ) edit : found this for another question , thought it would be applicable here as well : call of duty black ops weapon chart with damage , range , rate of fire , recoil , ammo , reload time , and body multipliers to help you choose the right weapon for you = )
yes . i have not done this personally , but i have seen videos of people attaching parachutes to an asteroid and deorbiting it . it is really quite simple , and the asteroids are relatively resilient . as for burning up or despawning , well that is just the same mechanic as everything else in the game . if you have a ship or piece of debris that is not loaded and it enters the atmosphere , the game will despawn it . if you are trying to land an asteroid , then it'll be loaded , and thus will not be subject to that mechanic .
when you are attacked you only lose gold , mana , and hb ( honor badges ) . if your heros die during the attack they will take a couple if minutes to recover . your buildings , if you watch the attack , will be destroyed , but when you log on they are rebuilt , like the attack never happened . edit : you lose ~5 hb if you lose .
you can not by default , but there is a mod to do this . try it out here .
since patch 1.9 there is no maximum level anymore . if you have a skill at 100 you can make it " legendary " . this resets the skill to 15 , gives all perk points invested in that specific tree back . be warned : you lose all the benefits of having a higher skill level ! the advantages of making skills legendary are : difficulty increase , since the enemies do not have their skills reduced . you can continue to level up and earn extra skill perks . it is possible to repeatedly make a skill legendary or to make multiple skills legendary , this allows you to ( slowly ) unlock all perk points . level 81 is the maximum level in skyrim without making any skill legendary there is a linearly constant amount of " experience " required for each level . the formula is simply : ( level-1 ) * 25 + 100 where level is your current level . " experience " in this case is earned strictly through skill ups . leveling a skill to x will give you x experience towards your next level . for instance , to level from level 1 to level 2 , you require 100 experience . this means you can either raise 5 skills to level 20 , one skill to level 21 ( assuming it starts at 15 ) , or any other permutation thereof . also , and this is important : there is no soft cap _ level 81 is just as ( relatively ) easy to reach as level 11 , it just requires more total experience . since all races have +10 to one skill and +5 to five skills , this means there is a total of 88,085 " experience " to earn , and this is constant across the ten races . level 82 would require 89,100 total experience , and is currently unreachable . thus , when your character maxes all of their skills , they will be level 81 .
i am not quite sure i understand it either . i have lost a couple battles with the retry option locked , and instead it just kicks you back to where you were ( just like the retry option ) . i think the only difference is that you essentially lose the battle , losing any items you may have used and that is it . not a huge deal , so do not worry too much if you fail . : )
early game strategy your starting location will probably have quite a bit of food , which will make it a good location to focus on population growth by building farms and other population increasing structures . then start to prioritize culture and science here . generally i focus on trying to get the relevant technologies to determine where iron is located , because it is an important early-to-mid game strategic resource . scout with your initial unit , and try to find ruins , as well as determine how much land and what kinds of resources you have available . if you have got close neighbors , war is likely in your future , so you may need to adopt the honor cultural policies . if you have got lots of land , focus on liberty cultural policies . if there is not a lot of land , and you have got no close neighbors , focus on tradition . your second city should be built when your first city is at around population 3 - 5 . build it in a hilly or forested region , but try also to incorporate nearby tiles that contain special resources . focus on building mines and production/military enhancing buildings . when your military is weak , or new technology makes better units available , start cranking out units until you have around 2 per border city , and then build at least 2-4 ranged or artillery units per border with another civ . your second city should focus almost exclusively on production , so if your military strength is good for your technology level and known nearby enemies , you may want to consider building a wonder or two . after you get to at least about 3-5 population in both cities , found a third city . this time , look for plains , grassland , and special resources . focus this city on economic and scientific output . beyond this point , my general strategy tends to diverge depending on what the state of the game is . ideally , by your third or fourth city , you have researched enough in order to be able to detect iron , and you should prioritize building a city near an iron deposit . you can continue growing by founding new cities , so long as you keep an eye on your treasury , military , and happiness . mid-game strategy at this point , it is time to stop and consider what the state of the game is . war ! uh ! what is it good for ? expanding your borders ! if you have got close neighbors , try to land grab between you to secure contested resources , and begin preparations for war . your production city should have buildings that boost initial unit experience . you may need to shift your capital to military production , or perhaps found your 4th or 5th city in a production-heavy area . focus your technology to research catapults , and then build at least 2 or 3 , but depending on how wide your shared borders are , you may require more . you will also want at least 3 or 4 of the strongest melee units you have available , and hopefully the great general from the honor policy tree . when you have amassed your army , place a catapult in each of your border cities , with melee units in the hexes that face your enemy . then , declare war on your neighbor . now wait . do nothing until their army marches out to your territory - and then bombard them with your catapults . they will be damaged enough that you can pick them off with your melee units at your leisure . when they start to beg for mercy , push into their territory and steamroll them . depending on how the war is going , ( and your civ 's happiness ) you might opt for peace eventually , but in the general case you want to wipe them out and take their capital if you can . i tend to puppet captured cities to avoid a major negative happiness hit . your technology focus should be primarily on better military units , but do not forget that as you conquer , you are going to need significant happiness improvement buildings . additionally , you can not neglect science or you will be lost in the arms race . expansion - it just keeps getting bigger ! if you have got nothing but open space surrounding you , focus on expanding to take resources nearby while maintaining firm control of your happiness . all these extra resources will give you major bonuses to production and science , but your required culture for next level will increase dramatically . continue to focus your cities depending on their location ( either population , economy , or production ) , but be sure to prioritize happiness generating buildings so that you do not outgrow your ability to sustain your civilization . eventually , you should encounter neighbors , or your science output will dwarf your opponents and you will be in a good position for a late game science victory . stay prepared for war by keeping your cities defended and your units up to date . you can trade excess resources to your neighbors for money to fund your other projects during this phase as well . technology wise , prioritize techs that give you city improvements , especially bonuses to science . you can take a small science lead and turn it into a much larger one if you spend your early science points wisely . camping - it is a legitimate strategy ! if you have got little land but no neighbors to speak of , you are probably on an island . prioritize becoming ocean-worthy with your technologies , and focus on culture in the meantime . the cultural bonuses are worth having , and you can use the fact that cultural policies are easier to gain with smaller civlizations to your advantage . snap up as many as you can ! if you are at a disadvantage ( ie , you have got a small island whereas your opponents all have more land ) - try to settle a larger island as soon as you can . no amount of small-civ culture bonus will make up for the fact that more resources and more cities gives you a significant advantage . if you are all on tiny islands , try to be strategic where you settle , so that you do not end up with cities that are not really contributing anything but are draining your happiness . late game strategy by this point , you should already have a pretty good idea about how you are planning to win . if you have dominated several of your neighbors , continue down a military path and stomp anyone in your path . if you have got several of the cultural trees locked down , focus on cultural victory . if you have got a big landmass and enemies are too far away to wage war effectively , you have got some options . diplomacy works best if you have got a large amount of cash . build the united nations , and then prior to the election , bribe all the city-states you can find . if you can get them to be your allies , your election is a lock . if this is not an option , focus on science and build the spaceship . note that as you grow closer to victory , the ai is going to try to stop you by any means necessary . keep your military power up with the same mix of units - ranged siege units defended by melee units . be ready to fight wherever you have borders . conclusion hopefully this gives you a general strategic overview of the game . this is not the only way to play , but i have found it to be successful not only in civ 5 , but also in several other games in the series previously . i have not said a single word about wonders or great people , for instance , but you should be able to figure out what to prioritize based on which of the strategy paths you are following . specialization of cities is the #1 thing i learned that took me from " intermediate " player to " advanced " player in the civ series . do not build all the structures in all the cities , lest you bankrupt yourself . focus cities by choosing the correct tiles to found them on in order to maximize the utility of individual buildings within the city . also , be strategic about placing your cities so that they can benefit from resource tiles . to maximize score , you should be aiming for a domination victory ( secure all capitals ) , as it requires the fewest amount of tech to pull off , so you can do it relatively early in the game . when you get good at waging war , you should be able to conquer a neighbor almost every time you hit a new technology level for your siege and melee units . however , civilization is a game where there is not one " right answer " - so play it the way you find the most fun !

it was a limited time offer for new accounts only , and the offer has since ended - though i think some of them had been a part of other limited time deals as well . from the same page as you linked : this item was introduced for a limited time starting on 2011.10.28 and was given free to all new pilots through the redeem system . at a first glance this item seems severely overpowered , but as it is actually impossible to use on players older than 35 days and thus with extremely low sp , this item actually provides quite a large boost to a new players effectiveness without allowing that new player to get anywhere near an older players skill at damage dealing .

according to the forums on gamefaqs , the answer is no . a better source is this article which states the same . d3 was never designed for cross-platform multiplayer . here is yet another article confirming that sad truth .
these are called slider gems , it means you can play these notes by sliding your finger between them on the slide pad instead of tapping each note . from the wikipedia page : guitar tracks feature notes connected by a semi-transparent purple line [ . . . ] called " slider gems" ; the player can play these notes by sliding their fingers up and down the touch pad or by tapping the fret buttons without strumming .

can support ? sure . every champion can support . you can also play every champion on full ad and most of them also on full ap . the main question is : is sejuani better than other supporters ? now i agree with most of the points you listed in the pro vs con in comparison to leone except for one . sejuani does not deal more damage than leona . while yes she does more damage on her own , one of the main reasons why leona is so strong is her passive which will get triggered by different friendly damage spells . let 's take a look at the more popular supporters in the current meta ( except for leona , your points are right if we do not look at the damage factor ) thresh huge utility with lantern , aggressive and defensive well placed hook can change a lane/game his e provides a strong offensive and defensive mechanic can harass with autoattacks nami great sustain aoe cc chain can buff damage , movementspeed and on-hit slow can harass with autoattacks morgana longest hard-cc in the game ( 3 seconds , 5 seconds if chained ) can negate stuns damage dealer in late game now as you can see : the things sejuani is lacking are long cc chains , carry protection , damage and utility . if one of these things were added or improved , i am sure she would make for a great support but currently there are far more viable choices . now as i said , this does not mean she is completely unviable as a supporter , who knows maybe you can get to challenger by playing a mastered support sejuani but remember : winning games , no matter what rating you are at , is possible with every champion but usually adapting to the tier lists and meta is a lot easier .
after some short testing , and with this uesp article , the conclusion is simply : it increases your max . health and your current health for the duration of the potion . once the potion 's effects fade , you lose the same value in max . health and current health . that is , unless you would die just from this - you will always have at least 1 health remaining from the potion ending : alchemy description : health is increased by &lt ; mag&gt ; points for &lt ; dur&gt ; seconds . enchanting description : increases your health by &lt ; mag&gt ; points . fortify health boosts the target 's health by &lt ; mag&gt ; points . when the effect expires , the target loses points of health unless that would reduce the target 's health to 0 or less ; i.e. the target is left with at least 1 health point when the effect expires . note in particular the last sentence . ( the same obviously applies to the other fortify potions as well . )
this wireless receiver product description on amazon specifies that you can use up to 4 wireless controllers with one single receiver . to pair multiple controllers to the same receiver , simply follow these instructions for each separate controller . to summarize the instructions : plug in the gaming receiver to a usb port on your computer use the " install automatically " option if the add new hardware wizard pops up download the xbox wireless controller software from here and install once installed , turn on the controller by pressing the middle ' x ' button press the connect button on the receiver ( the light flashes green ) press the connect button on the wireless controller ( pictured below ) . your xbox wireless controller should now be connected to your machine . repeat steps 4-6 for each additional controller .
"2* feeders " and "3* feeders " refer to lvl 1 guardians . lvl 55 is the maximum level for 4* guardians . rebirth allows 4* guardians to reach lvl 60 , but that is uncommon for 4*s .
are the protoss fairly micro heavy in the early game ? i agree with other posters that protoss benefit from micro , but that so do all the races . protoss do get an early " caster " unit in the sentry , and do benefit from micro to save wounded units since their shields recharge , but then zerglings benefit from careful surrounds and marines benefit from grouping and stutter-stepping . it is true that you see pro players using forcefields to incredible effect , but you will also see them do amazing things with reaper scouting/harass , expand-blocking with workers , and so on . use these tactics if you can , but they are by no means required unless you are in the top levels . at my level i rarely see sentries , let alone good forcefield usage . can an underpowered computer limit your ability to micro in a game ? sure , but if your pc is lagging enough to mess up your micro in the first battle of 10 vs 10 units , it will be completely unplayable in the later stages of the game . therefore if the game is still playable in the late phases when you have big armies , you should have no problems early on . later-game micro could be a problem , when you have tons of units , but that varies pc to pc and you just have to try it out .
it is kind of difficult to give a hard rule here . however , if i was pressed for a rule of thumb , i would say that if your capital city and the tiles immediately surrounding it are more than half tiles that give no base food ( ie , desert , ice , mountain , snow ) , then you are probably in trouble . in fact , without a balance of food and production , you are probably going to be at a disadvantage , so some forest or hills would be good as well . in this case , you can move your initial settler to a slightly better tile . if you can do this within , say , a turn , you are probably not too bad off . if it takes longer than that or the surrounding area is just completely barren , you are probably at a significant disadvantage . if you are in a slightly bad location , it probably just means that you need to found a second city earlier than you normally would . usually your capital will be a powerhouse , but if you spawn in a poor location it might not be . you can avoid this situation altogether by playing on more balanced map types - there are some that are completely devoid of desert and ice , for instance . disabling start bias is also an option if you really want to play as a civ that usually starts near vast swaths of desert or ice .
it may be possible but not easy . it depends on how much data was actually erased and how much has been written since then . restoring deleted files on an xbox is similar to restoring pc files . when files are deleted , they are often not actually deleted- the system just erases any reference to the file and may overwrite it when it needs to . to get the data back , you would need to somehow connect your hard drive to a pc and access it , then run some disk rescue software on it . this might retrieve your save .
being able to give gil to your retainer is likely just a holdover from version 1.0 of the game , where retainers would more directly carry out buying and selling items in the markets on your behalf , so there was actually a purpose to giving them money . for example , you could set up your retainer with a stash of money and a " buy " order , so that other players could choose to sell items to your retainer for an offer price that you set up ahead of time . likewise , for a period of time you could put your gear up for repair with your retainer , along with a gil reward for any players that repaired that gear . although it currently serves no necessary purpose right now , some players like to use their retainers as a piggy bank ; a place to squirrel away money so they can not impulse-buy things from the market wards as easily . : )
yes , rollerskating does count . i was able to rollerskate the last few hundred steps of my eggs life-cycle and they still hatched .
a sneak attack is not the same thing as a power attack . however , you can perform a power attack while sneaking . these power attacks are affected by all of the normal modifiers .
as you guessed , killing your pet either directly or via some indirect actions ( such as displacing it into a body of water ) can potentially anger your god or affect your stats . however , yes , there are a few ways that you can separate yourself from your pet , with no negative consequences : abandon it by changing floors while it is more than one square away from you . let it get killed in combat with a tough dungeon monster . the gnomish mines are a pretty good early-game place to find such monsters . let it get caught in a trap ( often easier to do by accident than on purpose ) dip or quaff from a fountain , and let it get killed by the monsters that may appear use a scroll of genocide ( unlikely and incredibly wasteful ) all that said , you may want to reconsider . if you let them get enough xp to level up properly , even your starting pets can become incredibly powerful , and will be very helpful to you in combat during the earlier parts of the game . if you are getting annoyed with your pet 's movement patterns , using a leash ( if you can find one ) will keep your pet closer to you , and keep it from moving quite so erratically . additionally , later into the game there are some incredibly powerful dungeon monsters that you can tame to be your pet as well , which can be a huge benefit .
if you pay the $0.99 , you will get : 5 more moves 3 lollipop boosts you can still lose , even with 5 more moves . if you do , you will be back on this screen again . thus , if you do not think you can win with just 5 moves , this is probably a terrible deal . ( although i think it is a terrible deal all the time , but that is me ) the lollipop boosts can be used anytime , and they will break a candy in a single square , with all the effects that entails - so they will clear jelly underneath the candy , for instance . paying for this has no effect on your lives - paying for extra lives is a different thing altogether .
letting jormungandr run into barriers seems to be an effective tactic . i used stationary shields ( e + right click ) and stone walls ( e + d + right click ) and just let the worm run into them . they do pretty decent damage all by themselves . with e + 4*d you get even stronger stone walls , those work particularly well . just running around and covering the whole area with stone walls ensures that jormungandr will hit something when he surfaces .
you get to re-evolve every life . this allows you to change the upgrades you have as the game progresses . for instance , celerity is better than adrenaline before you get leap , but with leap and wall jumping the extra leaps from adrenaline can be faster .
cities have different strength ( as seen in in the number next to the shield icon ) , but they all have the same number of hit points , i.e. 25 ( used to be 20 , this changed in 1.0.1.135 ) . so yes , you have to guess ( which sucks ) , but it is always against the same number of base hit points .
yes , you need to buy the plane to advance
no sadly they do not . they will always cost money for the sole reason that they are the best weapons in the game ! source-passed farcry 3 hope that helps ! charkz
this chest holds extremely good loot for your level . if you have not opened the chest yet , wait to open the chest for as long as possible . if you open the chest at max level you will get great purple or magenta ( e-tech ) rarity weapons . if you open it too early , you will have a very good weapon for maybe 5-10 levels , and then it will be useless . when playing co op with friends new to the game , make sure to warn them of the chest . it is an extremely common problem that people open the chest with no idea that it is special . it does finally have a warning that it will consume your keys when you try and open it now though . you get the keys by activating your preorder bonus or by entering shift codes from gearboxsoftware and randy pitchford ( president of gearbox ) on twitter . the promotional echocasts account also posts them less often than the other two . they occasionally tweet shift codes which can be entered in game to get keys . they release a couple a week or so . note that randy and gearbox do not post the same shift codes ( though the occasionally retweet eachother ) so you should follow all 3 accounts if you want all of them . be quick , shift codes expire either based on time or by how many people redeem them .
evidently , other people have this issue , or similar as well . sadly &mdash ; because of the arrangements with disney &mdash ; support for tiny death star is scarce . the knowledge base for tiny death star reveals only two separate bugs related to game progress , neither of which seems to match the described issue . there is this discussion about it on reddit ; this bug appears to be present on both ios and android in one way or another . as a conclusion , contacting disney support seems to be your best bet right now .
here is a list of data-mined feats of strength thus far : http://d3db.com/achievement/?c=5505067#1-1-0 they fall into several categories : " one of the chosen " - participated in the diablo 3 closed beta participated in the web promotion for each class ( earning the sigils by creating banners ) " discriminating taste " - bought the collector 's edition " in the land of killer unicorns " - get to the secret non-cow level for ideas " kill the unburied jay wilson " - kill a monster named after d3 's game director , in a special secret dungeon
no , you do not have to talk to lyle to receive your rewards . i hit the 10,000 point benchmark in the game last week , and when i checked my mail ( which i do immediately upon loading the game if i have any ) , i had a letter from the hha with the 10k tier reward attached to it . so it'll automatically be sent out without needing to check in with him .
you see the couple later on in the game if you decide to throw it at the announcer . well not too later . and they are like : " we want to help you . " . they give you something too .
actually , yes , and i believe it even extends to all of the bosses . if you stick to tranquilizer darts , gas grenades , batons , and stun guns , you can get through most fights without actually killing anyone . this is really easier said than done though , since non-lethal ammo is very limited , and you will find that the some of the boss fights are nearly impossible . if you are going to actually try this , sneak past as many guards as possible , conserving ammo for when you really need it .
if you only play multiplayer , then you are not missing anything by skipping gears 1 or 2 ( other than familiarity with the game mechanics ) . as for the single player , there is a story and it does tie up a lot of loose ends from the first two games ( i have not played much of the campaign yet , this is just what i have heard from reviews and such ) . there is a " previously on gears " intro movie that you can play before the campaign starts to get you up to speed . if you watch the intro movie , and possibly read about the plot of the first two games on the internet , you would probably have enough info to not be confused by the story in gears 3 .
one of the benefits would be that your disc will get less wear and tear . you still need to put the disc in , but after verifying it , it should not be read again ( though that will depend on the game ) . this should minimize the danger of scratching it if the console gets knocked . there should also be less noise as it does not need to keep the optical disk spinning . you might also get faster loading times - but that would depend on the game . an obvious downside is that you are going to fill your hard drive if you do this for all your games .
if you choose to join him , you get the " alternate ending " achievement . there is a brief cutscene , the credits , and then it essentially loads the last checkpoint - it shows your character just before the battle again .
pc — xbox 360 w , a , s , d - forward , back , left , right . i , j , k , l - camera controls ( second analogue stick ) c , x , v , b - d-pad page up , page down - rb , lb insert , delete - x , y menu / stats pages , etc : end q - a e - b lock on : o gesture menu : g controls your rolling , dashing , diving , etc : space toggle 1h/2h grip : alt right weapon attack , heavy : u , lmb right weapon attack , light : h , rmb left weapon action / block : shift left weapon action / parry : tab confirm : enter cancel : backspace note : if the xbox 360 controller button is not written , it is not known what the equivalent button is . please consider suggesting an edit to this answer , or commenting about it , if you know them . source ( s ) : i have got dark souls . the keyboard controls are really not intuitive but all of the above are what you get . the in-game hints system is pretty much useless as it lists the keys for the 360 controller . for example , when telling you to do a critical attack it was listed as " when falling , press rb " - menus did not say what that was but it is easy to work out when you start playing . my advice is - get a controller . the game is very fun and playable with the keyboard and mouse but you will probably start to hate life , especially with the lock on if you are using a mouse since it is highly sensitive and just pressing one of the attack buttons can switch targets so your attack misses and you die .
according to xbox support , you may need to try a reset of your display settings : check the connection for the a/v or hdmi cable on your xbox console . check the connection for the a/v or hdmi cable on your television . try plugging your hdmi cable into a different hdmi port on your television . reset your display settings . to do this : remove any discs from the disc tray . turn off the console . turn on the console . note if you are using an xbox 360 wireless controller , turn on the console by using the guide button on the controller . make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this . the player 1 controller will have the upper-left light illuminated . as the console starts , on the controller , press and hold y while pulling the right trigger . the display settings are reset to the default settings , and then the console automatically restarts . since you say you have done the first points , the display setting reset is all that you have not tried so cold boot the console and hold y + rt . there is also the possibility that your display is having trouble with the resolution that the 360 is using . it seems to want to default to the highest resolution which not all displays support . the quick test is to try it with a display that you know supports 1080p hdmi in and if it works without changing anything , then that seems to be your problem , but it may still be worth it to try changing the resolution on the 360 anyways : with an hd av connector ( some connectors have a switch on them for hdtv ) , ensure that the directions are correct , otherwise you are flying blind . with the current dashboard update : home button . settings ( all the way to the right ) . console settings ( down 3 , a ) . display ( a ) . hdtv settings ( a ) . try lower resolutions ( up and a selects a lower resolution , but since the menu wraps around , i can not be more precise ) . set it to the lowest resolution . power off the console . ( if working blind , unnecessary ) switch to the hdmi cable . ( if working blind , unnecessary ) power on the console . ( if working blind , unnecessary ) if that works , go through increasing the resolution setting to find the best resolution that works for your display . note i believe it should keep the setting even though you switch cables after setting it , but if i am wrong , you may have to go back and check if it lost your settings , meaning you will have to do this blind with the hdmi plugged in . you could do this blind to begin with to avoid this extra concern , but i find mistakes are more likely when you can not see . make sure to test it thoroughly before writing off a solution . sometimes xbox 360 takes a little bit of time as it starts up before it outputs to the screen .
armor types are exactly the same . a pristine helmet with +50 on each stat serves an identical use as a leather helm with +50 on each stat . additionally there is no " better " armor type at a given level ; leather armor with good stats has just as much of a chance to spawn as pristine armor with good stats . armor types exist for set bonuses . if you wear all the same armor type ( e . g . all leather armor ) , you get a 25% bonus to all stats on low tier armor . the set bonus increases with higher tier armor , up to ultimate gear at 40% . keep in mind that you cannot mix godly and below with mythical and above .
it is not wasting points . 100 stealth will get you much closer than reasonable sniping distance . however , there are quite a few enclosed areas in which you will have to get a lot closer than normal sniping distances just to be able to see your targets ( inside vaults , for example ) , and higher stealth will definitely help you there . furthermore , the number of points a high-intelligence character will receive by hitting the level cap is enough to max out almost every skill . there are actually a lot more skill points available than there are skills worth maxing ; maxing sneak is hardly a waste of points , compared to , say , maxing survival in a non-hardcore playthrough .
as far as i know , pavelow has always counted . only care package drops/sentry guns do not count and any killstreaks that you earned in a previous life do not count . all other killstreaks count towards a higher killstreak as long as you do not die . that is , if i were to earn pavelow via a 9 kill streak and then die , the kills that the pavelow will get will not count towards a nuke or emp .
